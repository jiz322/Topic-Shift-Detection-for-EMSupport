In that case, I would just tell them that you refuse to allow another dog to possible injure or kill your own dog, so you did what was necessary to protect your fur-baby.

At that point, if they still don't respond kindly, I'd tell them that you still feel as though you did what needed to be done, that you understand why they are upset, but that you will always do whatever it takes to protect your dog. Hopefully, they will stop being mean. Even if they just stop talking to you completely, it's better than them harassing you or something along those lines. If they do start escalating their nasty behavior, I'd let the manager of your complex know that you're being mistreated.

      "Great talking to you too. I am sorry to hear that you are very worried. Why do you think you might lose your class? Are you not good at the subject?\n",
      "I am just not understanding the way the professor is teaching. More than 50% of the class is failing at the moment. The anxiety is crazy.\n",
      "It sounds like it is the problem of the professor. It is always good think about the worst case senario. If, if, you really fail the class, what will happen?\n",
      "If I fail the course, I have a one time try to repeat the course again with the same professor. If I fail the second time, I can no longer go to all the colleges in that district to become a nurse.\n",

      "I do visit them during office hours along with numerous amounts of students, but it doesn't really seem to be helping. I'm anxious and starting to doubt if I do my career goal. I love clinical and doing my hours at the hospital but the tests are just crazy.\n",
      "I can see that you have great passion and you've been making efforts. My school was in a small capital city and the professors were not occupied with other students at all. \n",
      "Since you're good at actual clinical stuff, I think you can do well at the tests too. Maybe you need more time to prepare for the test?\n",
      "Thank you, I appreciate your kind words. Some times the tests just don't seem like what is being taught in class and the books. I have already taken extensive notes.\n",
      "Those tests are tricky, then I would ask more than a few questions in the class before the test. Students need to know what exactly they need to study in order to pass the test. I don't think most professors will mind helping students prepare for the tests.\n",

      "so you are saying that your grade is low and your professor is not listening to you\n",

      "\n",
      "yes, should mail or call him, leave a voice note if need be, tell him that you will take it up if he didn't respond to you\n",

      "\n",
      "the outcome will not matter because whatever comes from it I will know that I tried everything I could \n",

      "yes, it is holiday season. Have a nice holiday first and face the issue head on after\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree thank you for the help your messages gave me reassurance that I am not in the wrong\n",
      "\n",
      "once everyone sees that you have been trying to get in touch with him but he refuse to respond, then your case is already favored \n",
      "you're right i just have to voice my concern and the rest will be up to how they want to deal with it\n",
      "\n",
      "you are welcome. you are doing the right thing because this involves your future\n",
      "Things are ok I am just having issues with the problem above\n",
      "\n",
      "I am afraid that I am not able to see that .. can you tell me about it? \n",
      "Yes, so I have always done very well in school and university. I have always had A's or high B's. Last semester in university, I failed one of my exams. I still passed the class with an A, but for some reason, that exam haunts me and gives me bad dreams.\n",
      "I don't know why it happens and it worries me\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand that - when I was sitting my final exams I constantly had nightmares about failing. Nearly thirty years on and I still do!!\n",
      "But - you did really very well and you passed with an A. Do you think maybe you are being a little too hard on yourself? \n",
      "Maybe, I got a 46% on the exam (so an F) but I did all my other assignments and exams almost perfect and got an A overall. I never once failed a test in my life, and have always held myself to a very high academic degree to make my parents proud\n",
      "\n",
      "I come from a poor family, so succeeding in life is very important to m,e\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds as though you feel that academic success is the most important thing in your life, would I be right in thinking this? \n",
      "Yes you are correct\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you considered talking to anyone about these feelings of perfectionism? A therapist perhaps? \n",
      "There is a good deal of useful help and information out there for people who are struggling. \n",
      "I have not, actually. I don't think my family can afford a therapist, especially with the pandemic raging right now\n",
      "\n",
      "Where do you recommend going?\n",
      "\n",
      "Does your school have any counsellors offering help for free? Many do. \n",
      "I believe that there are some charities that will offer a certain number of free therapy sessions too \n",
      "I don't think any are available since my school is online only, also the campus i\n",
      "s completely closed due to Winter Break.\n",
      "Yes I think so though I am not totally sure. There should be someone at your school, online or not, who can advise you. \n",
      "I have never heard of such people, I am interested\n",
      "\n",
      "Really though I think that your problem is self esteem .. you should think better of yourself :)\n",
      "I can tell that you set yourself a very high standard but I also think that you need to be kind to yourself. \n",
      "I think you're right, but I don't know, I'm still scared about having the bad dreams. I often wake up 2-3 times at night because of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand that - this has been happening to me all of my life. Have you tried to take anything to help? \n",
      "I can recommend a hot milky drink before bed and perhaps a hot water bottle. Anyway I hope that I have been able to be of some assistance to you! \n",
      "Have a lovely holiday season. \n",
      "Thank you, I'll try to do just that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Merry Christmas to you\n",
      "\n",
      "And you :) remember to hit the quit button and take the survey ;) \n",
      "Hello there! How can I encourage you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better\n",
      "\n",
      "So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful?\n",
      "Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well.\n",
      "Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough.\n",
      "I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?\n",
      "I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. \n",
      "For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense.\n",
      "I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best?\n",
      "I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.\n",
      "Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.\n",
      "Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal.\n",
      "Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break\n",
      "I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe.\n",
      "Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. \n",
      "Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. \n",
      "\n",
      "HOw man classes do you have?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have 6 classes\n",
      "That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject.  Like a chore chart. \n",
      "Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you!\n",
      "Have a great day and thanks again\n",
      "You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello there! How can I encourage you today?\n",
      "I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?\n",
      "In about a month.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way. \n",
      "Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?\n",
      "Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track.\n",
      "Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.\n",
      "That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper.\n",

      "It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week.\n",
      "Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.\n",
      "My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that\n",
      "You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God. \n",
      "That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable. \n",
      "That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess.\n",
      "Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.\n",
      "My advisor is a tough woman, I'm not going to beat around the bush. She tends to make everything miserable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it! \n",
      "I'll try to keep that in mind. It's something I do feel like I need to finish for my own sake. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is only one more month of your life. If you buckle down, it will be over and done with before you know it. And I assure you, you will look back in pride at your accomplishments!\n",

      "My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards. \n",
      "That's a very poetic way of putting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not much in life is easy or free, if we keep working little by little, as time passes, you real a lot of rewards, in fact, you will reap rewards of finishing this thesis for YEARS even decades. It is a great goal and a worthy one to keep at. \n",
      "I'll keep that in mind as I move forward. I really appreciate your help.\n",
      "\n",
      "I commend you for doing the thesis and I also know it can get weary as time passes, but with some goals on paper a visit to the ADVISOR (hee hee) will set you up right for continued success. \n",

      "How are you today?\n",
      "I am okay I guess, I am really stressed and not sure how to handle it\n",
      "Im sorry to hear that you are stressed. Would you like to talk about it?\n",
      "Yes, I am not sure who to tell\n",
      "Well as a neutral individual i would be willing to listen to your concerns and or stressors. It can help to be able to vent to someone without judgement.\n",
      "I have a lot of homework and housework, and especially during these difficult times it is hard to get support and feel like I am improving in life\n",
      "It is really stressful and hard to plan out all the things I have to do, and sometimes I get a headache just thinking of it all\n",
      "I see, it must feel like a lot of pressure to get so much done during an already hectic season. \n",
      "Yes, and not being able to meet friends or go out much makes it hard to get all my emotions out\n",
      "Well first off that is normal to feel that way. I think most of us do but just don't speak up about it. Also being away from your friends and family can cause feelings of doubt because you may not feel like you have trusted ones to lean on.\n",
      "However\n",
      "You should try to take some time out of each day to instead of question yourself to congratulate yourself, because you are doing tough things on your own but hey youre DOING IT! \n",
      "Do you have any tips on how to deal with headaches or being overly stressed or anxious?\n",
      "For anxiety and stress i would sugesst taking time out away from all your chores and tasks and just be to yourself. What is something you enjoy? May a cup of tea or an episode of the office. You always have to take a moment for yourself \n",
      "So something like going for a run, or watching a funny movie?\n",
      "Meditation, yoga, a warm bath these things can also be soothing as well. SOmetimes using kinectic energy up can help as well like going for a brisk walk to burn off the adrenaline that causes anxiety\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for the ideas\n",
      "But what if you get so stressed you can't really think of anything else?\n",
      "Yes! Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment\n",
      "IF your stress has become that high, then you go ahead and aknowledge the anxiety that is flowing through you. Give it you attention and close your eyes and start to ask yourself what is the root of what is scaring me. What is the official thoing i am afrad of or worried about. When our thoughts begin to race its hard to focus and we make mistakes and that adds to the stress. \n",
      "Thank you so much, your advice will be really helpful!\n",

      "Do you have friends in your class you can plan a study group with?\n",
      "i recently moved to a new school\n",
      "It can be hard to make new friends in a new school. I'm sure the stress of being new isn't helping with the studying.\n",

      "i am currently clueless.. sad\n",

      "\n",
      "I've never gotten bad grades before this year.\n",
      "So you are having trouble with Virtual school being so hard and it's causing you stress, am I understanding correctly?\n",
      "Yes, that is correct.  I need to be in a classroom to really grasp the material, I think.\n",
      "I remember being in your position\n",
      "I know it's very hard and I am so sorry that you are stressed.\n",
      "I just want to quit school because I can't seem to do better.\n",
      "I know you said you want to quit, but hang in there! \n",
      "I wish I knew how long we would have to be virtual.  I don't think I can last another semester teaching myself from home.\n",
      "It sounds like you have always done well with school, this virus has made it to where so many people are struggling. Just chatting with you, I can feel how stressed and anxious about it you are!\n",
      "Yes, I was always an honors student so this is a huge change for me.   I'm afraid it will reflect on my GPA forever.\n",
      "I know that the situation with virtual learning is out of your control when it comes to how long it will last but is there anything you could do to relieve your stress while you are trying to learn things yourself?\n",
      "I tried exercise to see if that would help.  It hasn't really helped because the time I spend exercising I just think I could be studying.\n",
      "When you start feeling stressed maybe you could try deep breathing for a few minutes to relax again. Or take a quick break and get some fresh air?\n",
      "Is there anything else that you do in any other situation that would normally help you relax?\n",
      "I could try deep breathing. Fresh air is hard because we're in the middle of a snow storm!\n",
      "I like to go to a spa when I'm really stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh wow that would make things complicated! But yes the deep breathing would definitely help, I'm sure!\n",
      "I will try the deep breathing more often.  \n",
      "Maybe you could reward yourself with a spa trip ever so often, since you enjoy it? \n",
      "That's a good idea.  Maybe I could make it a reward for a good grade on a test.\n",
      "Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it might too!\n",
      "Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, how are you doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, I am doing well. How are you doing today?\n",
      "I'm doing alright, I'm facing a lot of academic pressure from my program and I feel trapped\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, it sounds like you are stressed from the academic pressure that you are facing right now?\n",
      "Yes, I have a lot of coursework but I have no help from from my advisors. A few of my peers feel the same way. Not sure what to do. I don't believe remote learning is helpful in a master program because the professor/advisor are not always available. \n",
      "I see how this can be stressful for you and your fellow peers. Have you tried other steps besides the one's you tried before by contacting the professor?\n",
      "I tried, but the coursework is difficult and the other solution is tutorials on youtube but there is so much you can do on your own. Plus I have a job as well, so limited hours\n",
      "\n",
      "I can relate to this because it is hard to work and do school as well. I can tell it makes you feel concerned about your schooling and you want to do the best you can. \n",
      "I wish so, do your best and hope for the best I guess. \n",
      "You are doing great I believe and really trying hard to do your schoolwork right.\n",
      "I just need to deal with the stress so it doesnt effect me\n",
      "\n",
      "Why do you think that might be? \n",
      "I feel that the stress is effecting my sleep and my work, because I constantly worry. Any tips?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would try to have a regular to set a goal for each day by stating to yourself today is a new day, remain focus on the task at hand, try not to worry about all tasks at once, and lastly try to find a relaxing sleep schedule that fits your needs.\n",
      "I see, I think making a schedule and breaking task into little ones will help complete them. I guess I will stress less.\n",
      "Yes, It will be hard at first because you are not use to it, but once you get started your life will be so much more relaxing. Your stress level will become more less than what is was before. Also, You will be able to have a clearer mind to concentrate on your schoolwork more by having this new schedule. \n",
      "These message is really helpful and I will start doing what you have told me as soon as possible. I just want to live happily but thank you for this conversation. \n",
      "I am glad to hear because you can do it. I believe in you. I am happy that this really help you and you are so very welcome. \n",
      "Thanks for the distressing tips and other tips as well, I wish a happy holiday. I do feel a lot better. \n",
      "I wish you a great school semester because you deserve it. I am glad you feel better and continue keep this motivation about yourself to bring out the best you can be. Never settle less. You are so welcome, and I wish you a Happy Holiday as well. \n",
      "Hello, I have been feeling very anxious and stressed recently.\n",
      "Why have you been feeling stressed and anxious? \n",
      "\n",
      "I failed my first exam earlier this week and I have 2 more later on in this week. I am already disheartened about my first failure and I am scared that I will fail again.\n",
      "I'm sure you tried your best on that test, as long as you study hard I believe you can ace those next 2 exams!\n",
      "I have been too stressed about my other exams, it's making it hard for me to focus on studying and I don't know what to do.\n",
      "I've heard that meditation can help with stress and focus, maybe you could try meditating for a bit before you study?\n",
      "I have never tried meditating before, I have no idea where to start.\n",
      "Meditation is essentially focussing on breathing, you could start by closing your eyes and slowly breathe in an out.\n",
      "I feel like a failure and I am scared my parents are going to be disappointed in me\n",
      "From what you're saying to me, I feel that you don't believe in yourself very much.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess you are right, I need to believe in myself and my abilities more. \n",
      "I just don't know how sometimes.\n",
      "I've struggled with the same thing before, whenever I doubt myself I look back at all i've accomplished and look at myself in the mirror and tell myself that I can do it. It has worked well for me.\n",
      "What if I fail another exam this week? I need at least an 80% to pass my class, I am so worried.\n",
      "Psychologies studies show that spacing out your studying and relearning helps you remember more information, you could try to section off your studying and then reviewing information before the exam!\n",
      "That seems like a good plan, hopefully I will be able to get the score I need to pass.\n",
      "I'm sure you'll do your best and pass that exam with flying colors!\n",
      "Is there any other piece of advice you have for me before I get to studying again?\n",
      "I have two actually! 1. Do not procrastinate as that will only cause you more stress and 2. Believe in yourself! I know you can do it, you should too!\n",
      "I appreciate you helping me, I am feeling much more confident!\n",
      "Of course! I'm glad you're feeling more confident!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi there, how is this season treating you? \n",
      "It's alright. Definitely not as cold as last year which is something to be slightly thankful for.\n",
      "Well let's be grateful for small mercies :). How are you feeling in yourself though? Is there anything you'd like to talk about? \n",
      "I'm worried about grad school \n",
      "Ah I am sorry to hear that. Please try not to worry too much as it's a common worry to have. Do you want to tell me the details? \n",
      "Sure. One of my classes is extremely difficult and the professor has not been responsive at all. The TA is kind enough to make time to help me with homework, but my grades are still not great. It makes me feel really dumb and undeserving to be in that class\n",
      "So you are feeling as though you are in the wrong place? Do you feel as though you might fail your class completely? \n",
      "I want to be in the program, it's just that I feel like everyone is so much smarter than me and my performance in that class makes me question my admission into the programs sometimes. When I feel like this after submitting homework, I end up crying because I just want to do well. I enjoy this field, just not this  class in particular. \n",
      "I'm afraid of failing, but I'm not sure if that should be a concern either. Over the past 3 years, no one has gotten a grade lower than a B. \n",
      "But do you really think that you would have been admitted to the class if you were not up to the standard? Do you think that maybe most of your classmates are secretly feeling the same? \n",
      "Sometimes I think about that. At the same time, I feel like it's unfair to compare myself to others. \n",
      "This sounds like it might be a self esteem issue and not about your grades. I have felt this sort of thing myself and I do know how awful it is to be so hard on yourself. \n",
      "So what do I do about it? I don't want to keep feeling like this\n",
      "Have you thought about seeing a therapist? Does your school have any free therapy programmes you could use? \n",
      "I don't think my school has free therapy programs. I have thought about seeing a therapist but I've heard therapy is very expensive.With student loans, I didn't really put much more research into therapy past hearing about the costs.\n",
      "A far as I am aware there are charitable organisations which can arrange a few free therapy session for you. Perhaps you could talk to your doctor about it? \n",
      "I have had free therapy sessions before and I found them very helpful \n",
      "I think free therapy sessions would be a good place to start\n",
      "It would help you work on your self confidence and you might find that you are not doing as badly in school as you think you are. \n",
      "Yeah, there are definitely a lot of other things i'm insecure about\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I think it is probably just a general self esteem issue and nothing academic! \n",
      "Anyway it's been really nice to talk to you and I hope that everything goes your way \n",
      "I think talking about this has helped. I'll do a little more digging. Thank you!\n",
      "You're most welcome, have a lovely Holiday season. \n",
      "I am under a lot of stress these days.\n",
      "Hello, don't worry, I am here to help. Could you tell me what is going on?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is final's week and I am under a Helluvah lot of stress.\n",
      "School work is just pounding my brain.\n",
      "I am taking 5 courses this semester, too.\n",
      "I can definetely imagine how stressful the last week of school can be, especially taking 5 courses instead of 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, don't let this situation scare you or ruin  your holidays. There are ways to cope with said stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah.  I am glad you are here to help me think things through.\n",
      "I need to find a solution to my anxiety while I knock out paper after paper.\n",
      "First of all, do you have some academic counselor you can talk to? Help you organize your ideas or classwork? Can you refer to professors or fellow classmates for help?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, counselors are hard to get ahold of so close to the Holidays.  The so-called teachers are not that helpful.\n",
      "seniors must figure it out by themselves.....(for the most part).\n",
      "My roommate is a lunatic. \n",
      "Are you confident in your abilities to succeed in those classes or you think you might lack the materials or knowledge? Or perhaps time?\n",
      "\n",
      "I just don't know.  I am going to try my best to submit every assignment on time, even though the quality prolly won't be 100%.\n",
      "I am a perfectionist by nature.\n",
      "I am a bit moody and my roommates have noticed it.\n",
      "It's okto be moody given the circumstances and the stress you are going through, and I think that you should attemp to complete all the assignments even if you don't get a 100% on them.\n",
      "\n",
      "That will show the professors that you are responsible and care about the subject or perhaps your major.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that I need to research more to ace this out.\n",
      "Accomplishing to submit everything will also make you feel good with yourself!\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important than you take your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Most so-called professors are snobs and their TA's are worse.\n",
      "Academia is full of lazy admins and lame teachers.  Plus, the student loan costs are atrocious.\n",
      "I understand that college can be financially demanding.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a rip off for what you get.....\n",
      "Hopefully, my student loans will be forgiven by President Joe Biden in 2021\n",
      "My anxiety is from the costs of college as well.\n",
      "You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if Biden doesn't forgive it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to remain optimistic and shake away the anxiety, it won't do you\n",
      " any good.\n",
      "Yeah, but big debts are big debts\n",
      "Do you feel better after talking about all of this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, but do you think I should take a different approach to things?\n",
      "Or find some other way to release my anxiety?\n",
      "I am still anxious about the end of school\n",
      "\n",
      "Not at all, I think what you are experiencing is completely normal, and you just have to cope with it in the most optimistic way possible. Maybe getting your assignments done in time will be helpful for your anxiety. After that, you will have tons of time to spend with friends, family, or simply leisure time to do what you enjoy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, tha is true.  \n",
      "Thank you for taking the time to hear my grief.\n",
      "It is a pleasure to help : )\n",
      "Hi, are you having a good day at the moment? \n",
      "Today is okay, i guess. I'm just stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a general problem that you would like to talk about? I am more than happy to listen. \n",
      "Yes, I found out I didnt pass college algebra and my academic advisor is pressuring me to take the class over this winter break in order to graduate on time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I have been in new york city all year and my parents just got me tickets to fly home\n",
      "\n",
      "I really miss them\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that but try not to panic, just failing one class is not the end of the world. How do you feel about retaking it? \n",
      "I don't mind retaking it, really\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah so you feel that this is going to be severely disruptive to your plans for this winter break? \n",
      "yha. also, im worried i might fail again if i get too distracted by my family\n",
      "Is it possible for you to get any sort of private tutoring which might help you? \n",
      "i mean, tutoring is just another added time commitment. I really failed the first time because i was depressed and unmotivated. which is why I'm excited to be with my family finally\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah .. in that case is it possible to talk to your doctor? They might be able to get a special allowance for you given your personal circumstances \n",
      "yeah. that's another thing. I havent told my therapist or even my parents yet\n",
      "I think that it would be a really good idea if you talked to them about it. They will probably be a lot more understanding than you might think \n",
      "what if they're disappointed\n",
      "\n",
      "If they love you, and I am sure that your family do, then they will accept what has happened without criticism \n",
      "how do i even begin to start the conversation\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, do you have any siblings that you are close to and that you could tell first? \n",
      "yeah i told my twin sister, actually\n",
      "\n",
      "It is good to hear you have a twin. Are you very close? \n",
      "definitely. we go to different schools but we live together in nyc\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I think that it might be a very good idea if she could approach the rest of your family and maybe even your therapist on your behalf? \n",
      "yha she's better at breaking bad news than i do... maybe i can ask her. i think i should tell my therapist myself though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, your therapist is not, in my mind, as important as  your family. But I think that both will understand! \n",
      "yeah. well i feel much better about this. thank you so much\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello my situation is that I'm facing an enormous amount of academic pressure\n",
      "Hello. Academic work can be overwhelming at times. I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Could you tell me what the issue is in particular?\n",

      "Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though?\n",
      "Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes it's all virtual though\n",
      "Well at least is something. I am sure talking to someone who might be able to guide you academically will be a significant relief.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a good idea.  Do you personally recommend anything on how to balance my schedule and still be able to have my time to do other things?\n",
      "When I was at college, I usually aimed at 2 hours of studying everyday (+ homework) and I also aimed to have at least 2 hours of leisure time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college?\n",
      "I honestly didn't eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings.\n",
      "\n",
      "okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down?\n",
      "I would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve\n",
      "\n",
      "okay but is it normal to be upset?\n",
      "Of course, it is normal to feel upset. However, you should not blame yourself. No one is perfect.\n",

      "I do have an idea about it but I am anxious about choosing wrong and boxing myself into something I wish I hadn't chosen\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if you chose wrong, you will generally have plenty of time to make up your mind and choose something that you really like : ), plus, you can reach out to academic advisors, for example.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose you're right, I think I don't have confidence in myself that what ever I do choose, I will be good at it.  Good enough to make a life out of it.\n",

      "That is a totally normal aspect of human nature. It's normal to get bored of things even if we really liked them at some point\n",
      "Of course, some topics like those are more serious, but as I said, even if you chosed wrong ,you can always change your major.\n",
      "\n",
      "I guess thats right.  All I care about is helping others so as long as the choice i make supports that then it will be fine.\n",

      "Yes I have a bunch of courses that I need to do for my work, it certainly keeps me busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would suggest that you study as much as you can. The more prepared you are for that test, the more manageable you will find it and the less stressed you will feel.\n",
      "Yes I am pretty good about that but it just kills my free time because I am working full time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand. However, you need to be able to find some time dedicated to your school activities. You are the one who needs to decide how to insert it in your schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes honestly I am the main driver behind me doing all this schooling it is just going to be good for my career and I don't just want to stand still.\n",
      "I agree, once you have your career set up you won't have to worry about working and studying anymore. You will be doing what you like for a good living. Think about the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is certainly the plan\n",
      "\n",
      "Just remember not to stress too much about it. It's just one test at the end of the day, you can do this!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I am not super worried about it it is more the stress from not having free time, also insurance textbooks are not extremely exciting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that I told you to try to fit school time into your schedule, but the same goes with leisure time for yourself. Find an activity that you enjoy and try to dedicate at least an hour a day to it, be it exercising, playing videogames, reading a book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes that is good advice, I try to find time for myself but time seems to disappear sometimes\n",
      "Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority. Try to maximize your efficiency so you can do your work while having more time for other activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is helpful, I am just glad I will have a few days off after today\n",
      "\n",
      "That's absolutely great, make good use of them (^_^)\n",

      "\n",
      "You can meet all the team members and may meet the higher official to solve the problem\n",
      "He said there is nothing that can be done...he just brushes it off, and how do i tell my parents i need another semester to finish my degree\n",
      "\n",
      "Make an effort to solve it .Because there will be a solution for each and every problem\n",
      "well it seems the solution right now is to start over and add a semester...\n",
      "\n",
      "You can provide the doctor certificate and meet your parents to professor so that the actual reason can be understood by him\n",
      "I understand that part but it takes 3 semesters for a senior project so if i resart since this one is declared a failure i will have to add a semester...thats more money and maybe i loose the job i was to start \n",
      "maybe I am just freaking out???\n",
      "\n",
      "semester may be started. so, don't worry. If professor not doing, you can directly approach you principal\n",
      "you think it makes me look like a failure???\n",
      "\n",
      "No, I dont think so\n",
      "but if i was your kid would you be disapointed?\n",
      "Make a positive approach\n",
      "so you think i just need to talk to them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, but I make an effort to solve it. So, I need you to talk again.\n",
      "ok i will try\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, How are you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you like to ask something?\n",

      "How can I manage the stress of school?\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you studying from home?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and it's depressing not being able to go out because of covid.\n",
      "\n",
      "well, it is tough. But it is safe, too. \n",
      "And you do not need to drive, you are close to the fridge, too.\n",
      "Yes, I have a fridge in my apartment?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I do go out for fun, it can be relaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find it difficult to stay motivated if I'm in my apartment all day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have a balcony? Or can you go out to a back-yard? Or is it too cold now?\n",
      "Yes, but it is very cold\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the school is almost over. we are facing Christmas, New Year...\n",
      "Yes, but my school starts soon, in a few weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be stressful again.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all need some break from staying in front of computes all the day long. \n",
      "After holidays, who knows...\n",
      "Yes, there is hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "We do not need to face a risk of driving through the snow....\n",
      "and be in a good shape...\n",
      "Listening to meditation and concentration music might help....\n",
      "I think meditation can be very helpful for calming the mind. That's good advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "I use some small weights u to keep muscles in tonus. \n",
      "I see. Thanks for talking to me, I feel more confident about my school.\n",
      "I am sure your grades will be excellent. Best of luck! \n",
      "How are you feeling today?\n",
      "Hi, not so good to be honest.\n",
      "I've been feeling very depressed recently. I've been doing very bad in this class and that is just not like me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, so you are usually a pretty decent student? I'm sorry to here that you are experiencing this\n",
      "I was up until this pandemic started. I feel like this shift to online learning has really taken it's toll on me and my learning. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried reaching out to my professors and doing virtual group study sessions with my class mates, but for some reason, things just don't seem to stick that well.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know, a lot of students are really struggling with this new learning style, so it's very understandable\n",
      "\n",
      "Really? I feel like everyone around me is doing fine and that makes me feel that there is something wrong with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I'm just slow?\n",
      "\n",
      "Most people where masks of content, so you never know how much they are struggling. It's not always beneficial to compare yourself to others\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you having issues with focusing?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think so? I think it is just the way the material is taught now. We have these \"Zoom\" sessions where everything is taught online, but it just all feels so impersonal. We are expected to read things on our own and then come to class ready to do these activities. I just prefer the old style of attending classes, having someone teach me the material, and then going back and studying on my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it is also the social aspect of this pandemic too. I haven't seen my firends in person in a very long time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm worried that if my poor performance continues, then I might loose my scholarship.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happened when you reached out to the teacher?\n",
      "He just gave me some additional books to read, but I did not find that helpful. I really do well when I have someone teach the material to me, not just tell me to read on my own.\n",
      "\n",
      "But maybe I'm not able to do well because I'm stupid. I know I should be able to understand things on my own, but I just can't seem to do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think if you could teach yourself, the class wouldn't exist.\n",
      "Does your class have a study group?\n",
      "Usually schools offer free tutoring, because students volunteer to do it for credits toward a teaching degree. have you heard of that?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is always a way. You have to be smart to get a scholarship. You deserve to be in that class as much as anyone else\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried the group study sessions, but I feel like I don't retain as much. I just get very discouraged when I see how smart everyone else in my class is.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't know if my school offers free tutoring now. They used to, but I am not sure if they are still offering it due to the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll try that though. It might help to get one on one attention from a past student who did well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, they most likely do it over zoom. But it's better because it's one on one\n",
      "And thank you for the words of encouragement. \n",
      "\\\n",
      "I'll try your advice. Hopefully, things will take a turn for the better.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm confident that it will.\n",
      "hi I need help. I'm under academic stress\n",
      "\n",
      "What are you stressed about?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am failing one of my classic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm worried about my scholarship\n",
      "Oh, Covid is really having a negative affect on a lot of students, right now. Has school from home had anegative affect on you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, I feel like I can't focus because I'm back home with my family and I just feel like there are so many distractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's interesting that you find being home more distracting than being away in a dorm.\n",
      "Yeah thats really the reason I wanted to go away from college. I dont really have my own space when I'm here.\n",
      "People just come in and out of my room as they please in spite of how busy I am.\n",
      "Yeah sometimes families can struggle with the idea of boundaries.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also went away to school for similar reasons, but I actually found college life way more distracting tbh.\n",
      "Have you told your family about the issues your having?\n",
      "I honestly am worried that they will be disappointed. Maybe that's crazy. I just remember how proud they were when I got this scholarship. I don't want them to blame me.\n",
      "\n",
      "OK, that makes sense.\n",
      "Have you spoken tried speaking to your teachers\n",
      "Yeeah thats why im not officially failed. My teacher gave me an extention on my final.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I'm working on it, but i just can't focus.\n",
      "Okay, then I think you need to find a place you can claim for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either you can tell set up a study schedule with your parents and request to not be contacted during that time frame, then if they don't seem to have the ability to abide by that, you could try the outdoor seating of a starbucks or even an ikea or library.\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually was thinking of going somewhere else to study. but i actually like the idea of a schedule better. I will try that first. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello there. How are you feeling today? \n",
      "Im feeling a little down \n",
      "\n",
      "I am really sorry to hear that. Is it something specific that you'd like to talk about? \n",
      "Yes I am being dismissed from medical school\n",
      "\n",
      "I am really sorry to hear that! Is it related to the pandemic or have you doing badly in your exams? \n",
      "i am currently in the appeals process but i havent left the house in a weeks\n",
      "\n",
      "yes my child was having suicidal thoughts so my attention went there\n",
      "\n",
      "Please try not to worry. Do you have someone to advocate for you in the appeals process? \n",
      "no its all on me\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you should look into getting an advocate. You have a legal entitlement to have representation. \n",
      "because of the holidays it will be kind of pointless \n",
      "\n",
      "they will probably see my cause a few days before the scheduled meeting\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah I do understand. I have been frustrated when things grind to a halt at this time of year too. Can you ask for an extension on your appeal time? \n",
      "but thank you for your suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds very harsh, especially given the current situation. I suggest that you find out where you stand legally because I am sure that this can't be right \n",
      "Yes i believe so, i am currently looking into alternatives as far as future career goals\n",
      "\n",
      "I can tell you are feeling really hopeless and anxious right now. Do you have any fun plans for the season? \n",
      "i am feeling both honestly i do have plans but do not want to go\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it would be a good idea to try to coax yourself into going. You will probably enjoy it when you get there :) \n",
      "i have been to a few trips visiting family i did not really enjoy myself i want to be alone \n",
      "\n",
      "that is my current problem \n",

      "\n",
      "I am sorry. I suffer from depression also and am on medication so I can understand your pain. \n",
      "Unfortunately the current global situation is not helping any of us. It is terrible to feel scared all the  time. \n",
      "thank you I feel a little better knowing im not the only one going through this\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps you could make a list of things that you mean to do in the New Year to give you something to focus on? \n",
      "thats a good idea actually \n",
      "\n",
      "I use to have a journal but havent wrote in it for years \n",
      "\n",
      "it helped a lot\n",
      "\n",
      "Make sure to only choose realistic goals so's not to make yourself feel despondent and do not be too hard on yourself if something does not work out! \n",
      "A journal is a fantastic idea. You can track your personal progress over a period of time. \n",
      "Thank you youre right i put too much on myself \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, depression does mean that we can judge ourselves far too harshly. I have been guilty of that myself in the past. \n",
      "Yes it has bothered me for years and its like a weight on my shoulders \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope I have been able to be of some comfort to you and given you something to think about. Have a lovely Christmas! \n",

      "Well I'm glad to hear it, sounds like you've been managing pretty well then.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes because I am on winter break now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I assume that means you're in college then? So the stress of finals is over now?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I am. And yeah I just finished finals.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's good, I hope they went well for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "They did. Some were hard, but at least they're over now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, now you can relax and spend time with your family without the added stress.\n",
      "Well I hope you and your family enjoy the holidays and stay safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, you too. \n",
      "Are you with family?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, just my immediate family.\n",
      "Oh that's good. Staying safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely, the best thing we can do right now. Even though it's kind of a bummer.\n",
      "Yeah, hopefully things will go back to normal soon. \n",
      "I hope so too, this has been such a crazy year.\n",
      "Hello, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been better. I had a rough semester in school. \n",
      "\n",
      "So things haven't been going well at school. I think a lot of people are going through these days.\n",
      "It was alright at first but I failed a final that was worth 50% of my grade\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that. That's a heck of a situation to be in. Is there anything you can do? Maybe talking to the teacher about some form of extra credit? or is the final grade a lock?\n",
      "Yes, I already tried to appeal my grade. \n",
      "And the teacher wouldn't budge?\n",
      "Sadly, no. I think they were too busy to really take a long time to discuss it or work with me\n",
      "Was this for a course that was required for a major?\n",
      "It was a core class and I needed it to graduate \n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, if you're willing to give it one more shot, try to appeal the grade one more time. If that doesn't work, you could try talking the class again next semester or during the summer if it's offered.\n",
      "That does sound like a good idea. I am just so disappointed I'm not sure if it is worth it. \n",
      "I know what you mean. I failed a Calc class once and I felt so empty inside. But I pulled myself together to take it again and passed it. I think you can do it too.\n",
      "I think you're right. The class is tough and I know I can do it if I put my mind to it. \n",
      "Exactly! You've got what it takes to make it through the difficulty, and your experiences so far will help you.\n",
      "It is very intimidating but again I agree with you. Thanks for your input\n",
      "\n",
      "You're welcome. In the meantime, have a little relaxation time to ease your mind. Thinking too much about the class would be stressful.\n",
      "True! I can definitely use the time off before I go back to clear my mind\n",
      "I hear relaxing music and funny movies can do the trick.\n",
      "I love both of those! Great suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "How are you doing today?\n",
      "How can I help you?\n",
      "I need ways alleviate stress while studying \n",
      "It sounds like you are having some difficulty at school, I have definitely been there.\n",
      "yeah, it can be tough sometimes and feel like you're in a dead end situation\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I worked a dead end job for ages when I was younger and sometimes you just feel stuck\n",
      "How did you push past that job?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am going to be honest a little luck was involved I managed to impress a customer that came in and ended up applying at their work.\n",
      "Are you still with that job now, enough to consider it a career?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would say so I am an insurance broker, it has only been a year or so but there seems to be room to move up. You can find something too\n",
      "Is there any advice for getting out of my situation?\n",
      "\n",
      "aside from luck that is\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you give me some more details?\n",
      "I just find the work mundane and way too remedial \n",
      "\n",
      "That is completely understandable\n",
      "did you look at any websites or other job searching tools before you found your new job?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have you a few, there are also many ways to gain skills online that buff up your resume a bit\n",
      "what types of skill can I gain online?\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed is one of the better ones to look for jobs, honestly I would suggest looking at jobs that you normally wouldn't and see what kind of qualifications they need and see if you can get that done online.\n",
      "so filter based on my absolute needs and go for online skills that I can complete?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes I think that is a great idea, look for jobs that meet your needs and figure out what you can do to look attractive to employers\n",
      "\n",
      "I have tried glassdoor before, have you had any luck there?\n",
      "\n",
      "I used it a bit, I mainly used indeed.\n",
      "and have you showcased your skills using LinkedIn before? I have had that one recommended to me before, they said its a great way to neatly organize accomplishments and personal background\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes especially if you are applying for anything in a professional setting that is very important.\n",
      "do you have any examples of online skills you completed?\n",
      "\n",
      "coursera has a lot of great courses, it really depends on what you are looking for.\n",
      "if I was looking to enter the engineering field, any recommendations?\n",
      "\n",
      "Is that what you are going to school for?\n",
      "yes but I may change my mind\n",
      "\n",
      "What year are you in? most engineering programs have a practicum and that is a great opportunity to make contacts and potentially get offered a job\n",
      "yes I have been networking as I go\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly you seem like you are pretty on top of this I don't think you will have any issues finding a job.\n",
      "yeah I mean the topic was about final exam stress but we got on a tangent\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes that is fair enough, how much time do you have until your exam?\n",
      "While that is plenty of time to get some studying done:)\n",
      "yes I probably should, thank you for your insight!\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly I find that if you are going for the test right away I always like to just breath and relax a bit.\n",
      "yeah no use in cramming for more info when I could just chill out\n",
      "\n",
      "You seem like you know what you are doing, I think you will do just fine\n",
      "Hi! Are you having a good day? \n",
      "doing well, but it could have been better, how are you doing ?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am okay thanks. Do you have anything specific that you'd like to talk to me about? \n",
      "yes, I'm currently under pressure to retake a work certification program that is about to expire. I'm not quite ready and I'm about losing my mind as time is fast approaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see .. so you feel that you will not be able to pass this program at the current time? \n",
      "exactly and I'm afraid of losing my license if I don't, I feel like I'm in a bind\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any possibility of postponing this till a later date? For one  thing the world situation is very insecure at the moment and you have the right to say that you just feel that you want to self isolate right now \n",
      "Are you a member of any sort of union that might be able to liase on your behalf? There are plenty of organisations out there \n",
      "My biggest fear is that they are bringing in a newer version of the exam which will require a lengthy time that I don't have to prepare, I will be better off taking the current version, I feel overwhelmed\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, well, firstly I think it's a good idea to try to stay calm and not let yourself be overwhelmed. Is it possible to get any sort of tuition to prepare for the exam? \n",
      "No I'm not. It's tough for me right now\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very sorry. I remember very well the stress of exams and the horrible feeling that you might fail. \n",
      "Thanks for the understanding, the tuition is on me. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only option now will be to take time off from work and see if I can get myself ready in the little time I have\n",
      "\n",
      "I can tell how insecure you are feeling about this. Does it help to let you know that you are not alone? \n",
      "Yes, it helps I'm just hoping the company I work for will understand and give me the time off \n",
      "\n",
      "Are they normally understanding of things like this? Do you have a good boss? \n",
      "yes, I have helped them a couple of times when they are hard pressed on something and needed my \n",
      "help. I'm hoping they reciprocate and bail me out as that's my only hope. \n",
      "It sounds like they are pretty reasonable. I really hope that it goes well for you. Thanks for talking and all the best. \n",
      "Thanks for listening to me and offering the support, it helped me think it through\n",
      "\n",
      "I am really glad to hear it. All the best to you. \n",
      "thank you , it's been nice \n",
      "chatting with you . \n",
      "Please remember to take the survey :) \n",
      "Can you please share what is on your mind?\n",
      "Hello. I am dissapointed in the teachers that I always get. They seem to make my courses so much harder.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I just get incredibly unlucky at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see. You feel unlucky and disappointed that the teachers cause your courses to be challenging?\n",
      "Exactly. I compare myself to my friends and, for example, they get barely any homework.\n",
      "\n",
      "It almost seems unfair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Course work is already stressful enough but to be challenging in addition only adds to the pressure.\n",
      "Yeah. But I swear, every single one of my teachers just seems so imcompetent at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember an English teacher of mine, always calling me out in class, saying that she expects better of me when my papers weren't the best. Her class was hard and I worked hard to complete my assignments as instructed. Instead of her speaking with me personally, she'd embarrass me. I did not like her class at all. \n",
      "Those are the worst teachers. I wish teachers like those would get fired.\n",
      "\n",
      "I just want to have a chill time like most teenagers\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there enough time to maybe select more compatible teachers or speak with the school counselor about classes that work best for you?\n",
      "That's the thing. I never get to pick my classes. And they always give me crap recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I Think I need to drop by the office\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a great idea. I'd encourage you to speak with your school counselor to share your needs and maybe the 2 of you can come up with a plan to create a schedule with teachers that can help you be successful. \n",
      "I am absolutely certain that I am capable of succeeding at school without over stressing. Hopefuly this will fix the issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe you are correct! Less stress certainly creates a better learning environment. School counselors are your ally. Remember, you can go to them anytime you need them. Are you stopping by this week?\n",
      "Maybe. If I have time on thursday or friday, I think I will go.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so excited for you! This is a big step! Looking out for yourself, to assure you are happy, less stressed and learning the important things to be able to graduate.\n",
      "For your next year, asking upperclassmen about their teachers can give you insight on who you may have next year. The more you know in advance, the better you can plan for what to discuss with your counselor. So proud of you! I know you 2 will come up with an awesome schedule!\n",
      "Thank you. I will try my best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello there! How is life treating you at the moment? \n",
      "Hello, I have been concerned lately.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you have some worries about life? Would you like to share them? \n",
      "I keep failing online classes even when I seem to have them under control. I think it might have something to do with me playing too much videogames.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you feel that perhaps you are playing video games as a distraction from how bad the world is at the moment? \n",
      "No, I don't think that's it. I have been playing games since I was 6.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, so it's a long term hobby? I do love gaming myself I have to admit. \n",
      "Could you perhaps set yourself some strict boundaries, like you can only do a certain number of hours of gaming a day? \n",
      "I tried, but my online rank not being where I want it gives me anxiety\n",
      "\n",
      "and I keep coming back\n",
      "\n",
      "Just one more match, just one more, I keep telling me\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like you might have a genuine addiction to gaming. Do you think you might benefit from some counselling? There are organisations that can help. \n",
      "Do you really think it's that severe?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, if it is affecting your grades and the rest of your real life then it might be. And it's best to catch these things before they get worse. \n",
      "The thing is, I keep telling myself I have enough time to get my school work done. But sooner than later I realize the assignments are already past their due date.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you been getting into trouble with your teachers about this or has no-one noticed so far? \n",
      "Yeah, I have. They say that I am either super invested on my school work or that I lack any signs of effort at times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does your school have a counsellor? \n",
      "Yeah, they assigned me one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you feel that they have not been of any help? \n",
      "There are always external counsellors that you could speak to. How would you feel if, for instance, you were never allowed to game again? Would that significantly affect your quality of life? \n",
      "I really haven't reached out to them, so that's probably on me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do understand that it can be very difficult to open up about having a problem \n",
      "But I don't think I have a problem\n",
      "\n",
      "I just wanted to get plat in League of Legends\n",
      "\n",
      "My teammates suck sadly\n",
      "\n",
      "The trouble is that sometimes the person with a problem can be the last to actually realise it \n",
      "I hope that I've been able to give you something to think about :) It's been nice to talk! \n",
      "Yeah I might talk to someone.\n",

      "why do you need a form signed by your doctor?\n",
      "the school requires it for disabilty\n",

      "I am over the hill. I am 66\n",
      "I am trying to complete my senior year in Biblical studies\n",
      "Biblical studies sounds interesting. Have you tried to call your doctor?\n",
      "He is at a VA hospital and hard to connect with\n",
      "i understand. I know how you feeling and do not let this stress you out all the way\n",
      "maybe you will have to take out a loan if it comes down to it\n",
      "I just can't get the school to give me a variance so i can take my classes\n",
      "I will contact another school to see if they have a program for me\n",
      "You need to talk to your advisor or whoever is in charge of that and tell them what is going on\n",
      "The advisor keep telling me they need teh form filled out and signed\n",
      "maybe you should try another school\n",

      "i cant seems to focus in school, presure from home due to fight going on between my parent, all i could think of his them coupled with bully's in my school\n",
      "It sounds like the trouble at home is making it hard for you to keep your mind on school. Is that right?\n",
      "I can understand why you would feel that way.\n",
      "You also sais there is a bully. Have you talked to anyone about this?\n",
      "Bringing this up to a teacher can help. Have you tried that?\n",
      "no one seems to listen \n",

      "I can tell just from this short chat how upset you are.\n",

      "i have no friends, all they do is mock and make fun of you\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like those people are not your friends then.\n",
      "Do you have any hobbies?\n",
      "It might be a good idea to join a choir. That way you can meet people who love to sing just like you!\n",
      "i think that will do, but am still not okay think my parent is going to devoice  \n",
      "Sometimes it helps to bring up your feelings to your parents. Have you tried that?\n",
      "all they think of is their issue and themselves they don't care i existed \n",
      "I can understand why you feel like that. I think it's worth bringing up.\n",
      "It's understandable. Anyone would feel like that in your position. But I think you can do it and it will help!\n",
      "maybe i'll try but am still scared to approach them.\n",
      "Maybe before you talk to them, take some time to write down what you are feeling. You could even give them a letter to read if that makes you more comfortable.\n",

      "Its been so long since i have attended school. I barley graduated high school\n",
      "I dont feel i am cut out for college \n",
      "It sounds like you are a little apprehensive about attending school because you have not done it in awhile. Is this accurate?\n",
      "I can definitely understand that. I remember feeling a certain way when I pursued another degree. What would make you feel a bit more confident about the idea of school?\n",
      "I dont know to be honest\n",
      "It is certainly okay to feel nervous about it. This is a big step and a life-changing experience. You should be proud of taking that first step!\n",
      "What excites you about starting school?\n",
      "Im excited for the high paying jobs i can get once i graduate.\n",

      "That sure is exciting! \n",
      "There are many ways to prepare for starting school. For me, becoming more organized helped me in preparation for school. What are some things that come to mind that would help you mentally prepare for this event?\n",
      "breathing techniques come to mind.\n",
      "you have helped me identify that it is simply just anxiety and i can better handle it now. thank you!\n",
      "I feel so much better and more confident! \n",
      "Wonderful idea! Meditation and deep breathing have proven to be extremely effective. I'm so glad this has helped! How do you see yourself fitting in the breathing techniques this week?\n",
      "i will do the techniques before each class. That way i have a clear & open mind!\n",
      "Well Its lunch time for my kids, i guess that concludes this conversation! Happy holidays!\n",

      "so, i was assigned a 10 page paper, which i wrote 40, that was awesome. however, my these i was supposed to write 35 or so and wrote 40 also, i just feel as though i could have added more\n",
      " \n",
      "You already did way more than expected of you- 3.5 times as much.  And your paper was good enough to help you graduate.  Be proud of yourself.  You accomplished something great.\n",

      "Yes I have flash cards. That helps with the study but not with the\n",

      "\n",
      "I would recommend mixing it in while studying, maybe study for an hour and then take a break for an hour and the study again. This way it breaks up the monotony of studying\n",
      "\n",
      "interesting. never thought about it that way. it becomes less of a band aid. but it is still a crutch \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to think of it that way as well, but I then began to think of it as a reward for studying and that helped a lot!\n",
      "\n",
      "oh a reward for studying! that's a good way to think too. not a fix but a prize. \n",

      "\n",
      "Just to make sure I understand, you got a bad grade in one of your classes and your grade dropped below an A and you are upset about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes that is right\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you talked to your professor about the reason for the grade you got that dropped your grade below an A? Often it helps to understand what we did wrong in order to know what we can do to improve.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I have, she said she explain the rules out in the syllabus and would not change it. SHe gave our whole class a 0 on the final.\n",

      "hello. How are you tonight\n",
      "Hi, I feel somewhat concerned, I failed a test. I might fail the class. I honestly sometimes feel like college is too hard for me.\n",
      "I can understand how you feel.i am between classes also\n",
      "are your classes online in person\n",
      "A mixture. I currently have 2 online classes and 2 face-to-face ones.\n",
      "So you have a full schedule\n",
      "Are these mandatory classes for your degree\n",
      "May I aks what your major is\n",
      "Yes, I am in a full schedule. The class I might fail is mandatory for my Computer Science degree. That is why I am so concerned.\n",
      "Is it online in person\n",
      "That class in particular is online.\n",
      "Being online makes it harder. \n",
      "You think so? I kept telling myself that they were supposed to be easier, since its on the computer.\n",
      "Maybe the in person classes can be restructured, maybe you can change your schedule   \n",
      "If I fail the class, would you suggest I retake it in person then?\n",
      "My classes are online and I can chose my load. Are the i person classes more important then this class\n",
      "I would. But before you fail can you drop the class then pick it up in person\n",
      "I don't think I can, the withdrawal period ended long ago...\n",
      "Can you talk with your teacher for extra credits \n",
      "That could be an option, although he can be very rude at times. I don't think he will accept.\n",
      "Is there away to talk with him in person to explain your issue\n",
      "Ask for his advise in person versus the online\n",
      "I will consider doing that that. What if he doesn't want to give me any extra credit oppourtinities?\n",
      "\n",
      "I might have to deal with failing the class...\n",
      "\n",
      "If you get a failing grade you can take what you have learned and use it for the future\n",
      "That is true, I never looked at it that way. It might not be that tragic after all...\n",
      "Sometimes what we learn can be used to better ourselves\n",
      "I agree... I definetely feel a little better now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just take a step back and move forward when it is time\n",
      "Hello there, how are you feeling today? \n",
      "uninspired. broken. a rock. a static object. bananas\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, that's a start. Do I hear you saying that you're confused at the moment? \n",
      "not confused. frustrated that I have to produce art for marks when I am not inspired\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah I hear you, education can be both wonderful and difficult can't it? What are you supposed to produce? \n",
      "painting after painting. like I am an ikea machine, photocopying picasos for A's \n",
      "I can imagine that that is very frustrating. Would you consider switching majors? \n",
      "What is life but a stage. Art is life. I love art. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ah Shakespeare, a great favourite. I have had times when I have felt that there was no point in continuing with my studies too but it tends to pass \n",
      "Can you keep reminding yourself that this is for the good of  your future and one day it will pay off? \n",
      "does the sun now set and then rise again. Does the spring not come after winter. Yet I cannot see how art will give me grades.\n",
      "Well, I am assuming that you want to go into an artistic field on graduation? \n",
      "yes, but no like a 9-5 job. \n",
      "perhaps i am yet another art failure. \n",
      "art has no time \n",
      "\n",
      "I think you are putting yourself down unnecessarily. Many people do make a lucrative career from an art qualification \n",
      "I would urge you to keep working to the best of your ability and see what happens \n",
      "you speak the truth. I will again pick up my brush and see where my inspiration takes me.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh it has been a joy talking to you\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you ever tried searching for information about careers in your field? We still have a few minutes left :) \n",
      "There are a lot of different ways in which you can use an art degree! \n",
      "Yes. we do. I will call my newest work the brilliant support of mturk!\n",
      "\n",
      "pls give me more inspriation\n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds like a definite winner :) I see a Turner prize beckoning in your future \n",
      "wow. Turner. are you in the UK?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I am, where are you? \n",
      "Ah .. well hopefully things will pick up for you next year. Well it's been lovely talking, I wish you all the best! \n",

      "I've been better. How are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm better than I deserve. Does teaching your son give you a lot of anxiety?\n",
      "Yes, I feel like I'm responsible for getting them to do their schoolwork, maintain my mother sons relationship, and make sure that they do well in their schoolwork.\n",
      "It's a lot that is on my plate on top of the other things that I'm responsible for.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alot of parents are experiencing the same difficulty, even I am experiencing trouble with my child. It is a lot of alien stress to us when, in the past, we were only responsible for ensuring that homework is done.\n",
      "I agree with you there. It would be nice if they could be in school, but I understand that they shouldn't be.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd like more help and understanding from my husband, but he seems to be incapable of that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless I badger him for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's kind of a tired saying, but one strategy that has helped me is the One day at a time strategy. I'm sure you've heard of it. Basically, it means just do for today, don't worry about yesterday, don't stress over tomorrow, just treat this day as it's own task.\n",
      "I've definitely heard that before, but you are completely right. I need to stop worrying about yesterday and tomorrow and focus on today, but I'm just not very good at that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, within that, one task at a time. Segment things he wants to do then reward him with them upon successful completion of school-tasks.\n",
      "Yea, I definitely need to get better at doing that. I end up letting them play video games and with toys in the middle of the day sometimes because I have work that I have to get done as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "For my example, my daughter very much likes to play video games. In order to earn video game time I need two successful assignments. They have to be small, reasonable tasks, but also an amount of time that allows you to take it one bite at a time.\n",
      "I mean, think about it, how do you eat a cow?\n",
      "That's very smart on your part. I really need to learn to actually follow through and do that.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is true and a very strange reference.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, one piece at a time. I apologize for the strangeness of the reference.\n",
      "No, I appreciate the different references.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was just surprised by it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One piece at a time makes more sense than allowing myself to be bogged down by everything at once when I can only accomplish one thing at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't do it all at once, and neither can he.  It's not a perfect solution, but its a solution that has worked for me.\n",
      "You've made some very good points and I just need to get better at taking things one thing at a time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a strange new world. Sometimes we have to try strange new things to cope.\n",
      "That is definitely true. No one could have possibly been prepared for what has been happening.\n",
      "\n",
      "Covid has been disrupting so many people's lives in so many different ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm glad I was able to help.\n",
      "It's just nice to be able to talk to someone else who is experiencing some of the same things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you will find that a lot of your friends are in the same place.\n",
      "That is probably true, but everyone has been so busy that I've only really been communicating with my husband.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that adds to stress beyond the ad-hoc homeschooling. It is important to purposefully socialize by phone or chat with friends. We humans are social creatures, and you are not an island. We all need friends. My wife has been an amazing support, but I still make time to facetime with my buddies.\n",
      "That is a very good point and I should really try to talk to my friends more than I do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for the help today. It was nice to talk to someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm grateful to be of help.\n",

      "\n",
      "Hello, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. I am so nervous about my final paper. It's 50% of my grade.\n",
      "I can understand taking a test can be stressful.  Have you been studying for it?\n",
      "It's not something to study for but something I've been working on for months.\n",
      "What subject matter is it for? What have you done to prepare for it?\n",
      "What level of schooling are you in now?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's community health. It's a paper not a test. And it's a group project. We have been implementing a class in a homeless shelter for months and we are measuring the success on that implementation for the adult male population.\n",
      "And we have been finding research articles to support our project.\n",
      "Papers can be very stressful, especially when it is a group project. When I went to graduate school I had to complete 4 full papers on different subjects in 72 hours.\n",
      "Do you feel like you've made progress in finding the necessary information?\n",
      "Yes I understand it's stressful. And yes we've made progress.\n",
      "I'm sure that if everyone puts in the effort, you will all be successful with your paper.  Is there anything I can do to help?\n",
      "I can't stand working in groups because there is always someone who doesn't pull their own weight and it usually falls on me to make up for it. I just get so stressed out every time I think about it.\n",
      "I can tell you're stressed about it and group projects are very hard.  Perhaps you can all put a plan together an allocate tasks to make sure that everyone puts in their share of the work? Is that something you've considered?\n",
      "Yes. I've done that. But still have people who don't seem to stick to the plan.\n",
      "I've been in this situation.  Instead of stressing yourself about it, have you tried speaking to your professor or other group mates about making sure that everyone pulls their weight? Some professors take that into consideration.\n",
      "Yes I have talked to my other group members and most of them are on board. I could go to the professor. That's an idea.\n",
      "I found in my experience that professors are very receptive to hear about how others are performing in the group and will weigh that information when grading.\n",
      "Yeah you could be right about that.\n",
      "I hope that you find that suggestion helpful.  When is your paper due?\n",
      "In a few days.\n",
      "Well, the good news is once you submit it, you'll be able to enjoy a holiday break and hopefully de-stress!  I am sure that you will do great!\n",
      "Yes that's definitely true. I feel a little better.\n",
      "I'm so happy to hear that!  Sometimes we just need to talk it out a little !\n",
      "You're welcome and good luck with your paper!\n",
      "hi how are you?\n",
      "I'm doing well right now\n",
      "\n",
      "that's great you're doing well 'right now' but what happened prior that you weren't all right?\n",
      "I just took my last exam and I feel that I will fail and have to retake it \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh I'm sorry.  I'm sure you did fine.  We all feel that way after exams!  \n",
      "have you felt this way with prior exams?  if so, did you really fail or did you do okay?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, this was the first time I really did not study for this exam \n",
      "\n",
      "Because I had 5 class this semester \n",
      "\n",
      "wow 5 classes is a lot!  So you didn't have time to study?  Did you go to class and do the work throughout the semester?\n",
      "Yea it was a lot of classes. I tried to attend the lectures, but I was falling behind \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if you can contact the professor and go over your exam with him/her to set your anxiety at ease?\n",
      "Unfortunately I cannot since he does not teach during the winter semester \n",
      "\n",
      "how do you get your exam grade and test papers back?\n",
      "I took it last week, he will not release until the end of this week. I will await my remediation papers \n",
      "\n",
      "have you spoken to people in the class with you?\n",
      "Yea we had a big cheating group since it wasn't on examsoft but we all struggled hard \n",
      "\n",
      "maybe he'll curve the grade then if a lot of people didn't do well\n",
      "Nah it's a professional class. No curves since our class size is only 25 people \n",
      "\n",
      "oh wow.  hopefully you can re-take it then if you really didn't do well.  I bet if you go through your notes and your book and compare to test questions you did better than you thought!\n",
      "Yea do you want to finish and quit this hit? \n",
      "\n",
      "if you're good you can quit (I can't!)\n",
      "Great talking with you. See you later :) \n",
      "\n",
      "you, too!  good luck :) \n",
      "Damn, they want us to chat for 15 minutes. How are you? You stressed out? \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "oh wow!  I didn't know - 3 more minutes.  We can do it!  I'm glad I don't have to study and take exams.  After the exams are the worst!  Not too badly right now.  But every day is a new day :) \n",
      "I'm majoring in biology. It is very tough I'll tell you that \n",
      "\n",
      "This semester I took 19 credits. That was a mistake \n",
      "\n",
      "that's insane!  I did Chem and Bio ONE semester at the same time - with 8 hours of labs a week - I quickly changed majors.  I respect what you're doing!\n",
      "Thanks! What are you majoring in now?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am way past that stage - my son is starting college in the fall\n",
      "I am a day trader - business is a lot easier :) \n",
      "Wow, good luck to your son! I daytrade a bit myself too\n",
      "\n",
      "nice!  it's really fun.  I have a few 'gigs' I work on but that is my favorite.  And thank you about my son.  I don't miss school - he's already ready to graduate!  \n",
      "Hey, we defintely passed 15 minutes. It was great talking to a fellow MTurker.\n",
      "\n",
      "you, too!  Maybe we will meet again!\n",
      "Hello. How are you?\n",
      "I am well, how are you/\n",
      "\n",
      "Pretty well at the moment, but not so good overall.\n",
      "What is it that I can help you with?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I can't figure out a good strategy to study for my tests. I keep failing.\n",
      "What tests are you struggling with?\n",
      "\n",
      "Mainly, the ones that require memorization, subjects like political science, government, history, economics, biology. I don't really struggle with physics or math because it's more whether you can do the thing or not.\n",
      "So from what I understand, you are struggling with study strategies to help you pass your tests?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am in school as well and I struggle with ways to study for tests as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Are there any online study groups that you could join for these classes? I found it is very helpful to study with other students who are struggling in the same way I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, yeas, that was kind of working for me for a while, but now corona hit us, and all the classes are online. So group studying is no longer as efffective. Do you have any other methods of overcoming it, that you are willing to share?\n",
      "Have you thought about connecting through zoom, or google meet? Video conferencing\n",
      " has become very popular since COVID began. \n",
      "Yes, I could. It brings its own complications but it should be fine. \n",
      "It definitely takes some getting used to, but after you get used to it, it is a great tool@\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for the advice\n",
      "No problem! I know school is incredibly\n",
      " difficult, but I know you can get through this!\n",
      "Good evening. What would you like to talk about? \n",
      "How are you feeling at the moment? \n",
      "i lost those books, I cannot even explain, how it happen \n",
      "\n",
      "So you have lost some books? Were they important to you? \n",
      "I price one of the books, Amazon said 1000\n",
      "\n",
      "So you have lost a book that is worth a thousand dollars? I can imagine you are feeling really bad about that \n",
      "where will I g\n",
      "et almost 3 thousand dollars\n",
      "It is too painful\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not know .. have you considered taking an extra job on the side? \n",
      "Have you tried to get help with finding the books? Someone could have handed them in. \n",
      "school, should just give me enough time to find the books\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any idea of where you lost them? \n",
      "allow me to clear myself later, it is a fucking thing \n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry, I do not understand what you mean \n",
      "I am trying to find that out,  I packed them inside one bag , may be someone carried the bag or I misplace them \n",
      "Try not to worry, it is entirely possible that someone has found them and handed them in to the authorities. You might still get them back! \n",
      "i need enough time to look for the books, but school is not ready to listen to me\n",
      "\n",
      "That is really not fair of them. Is there a higher authority you can take your case to? \n",
      "They really should be doing more to help you. I know how frustrating it feels to lose something valuable. \n",
      "I did lose a really expensive ring one time but I got it back a week later \n",
      "yes , it is fuck\n",
      " giving me headache \n",
      "I can understand why it would be! Please try not to worry, all is not lost \n",
      "I just need time, I will check the CCTV\n",
      " of my room, and check around \n",
      "That is a good idea. I hope that they have not been deliberately stolen. \n",
      "Well, I hope that I have been able to offer some useful suggestions. Do you feel a bit better about things now? \n",
      "Thank you for talking and enjoy your day! \n",
      "you're welcome :)  you have to end the conversation from your end because I can't \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, how may I help you today?\n",
      "I am worried my child is falling behind in school.\n",
      "\n",
      "what makes you worried?\n",
      "His scores are not in line with where he should be.\n",
      "\n",
      "what grade is he in?\n",
      "He is in 4th grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "How is his report card looking?\n",
      "Ok. Average to below average. He has a good heart but he just doesn't like school.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand that. I hated school to.\n",
      "Have you tried talking to his teacher?\n",
      "I worry that he is falling behind. I think he will be ok but I also worry about him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We have talked about a month ago. His current teacher is out with a medical condition so with remote learning and and her being out, it has been tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know how you feel of course you going to worry because that is your child and you want him to do his best in school\n",
      "Yeah. Do you have children? Have you gone through this in the past?\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you recommended getting a tutor for him?\n",
      "No i have no children but i can understand where you coming from\n",
      "We have gotten him tutors in the past and it helps. I am not sure I could do a tutor with COVID-19. \n",
      "\n",
      "you are right. Have you tried helping him with his work?\n",
      "Has he showed you his trouble areas?\n",
      "I have. He has been ok with it but he gets frustrated when he gets pushed. I am trying to figure out where that line is and not upset him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, we get progress reports and the areas he needs help in.\n",
      "\n",
      "i understand. have you had a talk with him about his progress in school and tell explain to him why school is important\n",
      "I have talked with him. I think I just need to be more firm with him. I just don't want the fights!\n",
      "\n",
      "yes being firm with a child will sometimes help them understand \n",
      "He can have huge blow ups. I guess I just need to put on my big boy pants and deal with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "also i remember when i was in school my parents did this thing to where they would reward me with a toy or going to my favorite place if i got good grades and that actually worked for me it made me want to do my work and get good grades.\n",
      "sometimes something like that will help with children and sometimes it wont\n",
      "Ha! I just bribed him yesterday with a video game if he aces his upcoming tests. Thanks for your help!\n",
      "you should see how that goes and take it from there.\n",
      "I will, thank you.\n",
      "I am so stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, what's going on?\n",
      "I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part!\n",
      "do you have a bigger screen you can use?\n",
      "It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor.\n",
      "\n",
      "My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something? \n",
      "I don't have a second screen, but I do have a large TV. I may be able to hook it up via HDMI.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mute thing is horrible. I have no ideas for that. hahah. I'm looking for help with that too!\n",
      "Yeah try the HDMI hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you don't have the right connections. \n",
      "Sometimes I get really anxious. My ears will be pounding and I feel like I can't hear anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worse when using in ears, because it's like all I can hear is my heartbeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah if you stream it on your tv, you won't have to wear headphones... that way you can control the volume better too. \n",
      "That sounds like a great idea. Have you had any weird technological solutions to help you through distance learning?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not really doing any distance learning right now. Just working  from home and coincidentally most of my work uses excel. I have constant virtual meetings where I have to show people things via excel. It's pretty tough but I found if I use multiple monitors it makes things easier. \n",
      "I have considered making impulse buys to help with some things. Do you know about portable second monitor screens for laptops?\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems almost like a thin tablet that you plug in to your laptop. I like the idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "my second monitor is not portable. I don't know if that would work for me because I work better in one designated spot. So I have 3 monitors on my desk (2 separate monitors and my laptop screen). however something like That would definitely be something I'd look into if I was in school or taking classes \n",
      "I enjoy portability and minimalism to a fault sometimes. I enjoy being able to work from anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you live in an apartment or home?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's a good call! Do you think you can find a deal somewhere on it? \n",
      "I live in an apartment, I hope to find a good deal on Amazon. Amazon seems like a necessary evil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. How are you doing today?\n",
      "I cannot seem to focus on online learn. FU covid\n",
      "\n",
      "It must be very difficult to be a student during this time.\n",
      "It is so weird. I am a hands on. teacher talking to me kinda person. what the F\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that completely. It's very helpful to speak with people face to face. However, have you sought other ways, such as through Zoom, to interact with peers having the same difficulties?\n",
      "zoom is not the same. I am in a techincal trade and need my hands\n",
      "\n",
      "Classes that involve hands-on work must be very challenging to do online. It sounds like this is a real dilemma. What ways have you already sought to overcome it?\n",
      "trying to stay sane (patient) that the vaccine works and we get back to normal soon. FU lockdown\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel very much the same way. I am also a student taking online classes this semester. I can't wait until we get back to normal classroom settings, and I also hope fervently that the vaccine process is quick, efficient, and effective. I find that making regular online meetings with my professor, while it might not help with the physicality of your work, at least provides mental and motivational boosts. Do you ever meet with them in any capacity?\n",
      "honestly its all a shit show right now. Everything is tied up in logistics and stop and starts. this year has been almost a wash\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been the same way at my school. At least there is some solace in knowing that a large group of students is also struggling right now. Having a source of community support/commiseration is at least emotionally helpful.\n",
      "true, I guest if the ship goes down we all go down\n",
      "\n",
      "If there's only one thing to take from this, it's knowing you aren't alone. I have confidence that you, and this entire country, is going to get through these difficult times. \n",
      "I believe that too. thanks for the reassurance. I just have a hard time sitting still\n",
      "\n",
      "I definitely get that. It's especially hard because we've had to sit still for so long. It's almost been a year since things were normal. It's kind of like we're just waiting for real life to start again.\n",
      "imagine when it happens. when everything is the way it was a year ago. a beer. at a bar. \n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds incredible. Or just to be able to go into a store without a mask and hand sanitizer and constantly monitoring how close you are to people. It's almost impossible to imagine, to be honest. But when that day finally comes, it'll be one of the best days of my life. We can finally start putting all of this behind us. \n",
      "thanks fo the chat. i feel better. stay safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "im hitting the books\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks! I hope this helped relieve some stress, at least. You stay safe, too.\n",
      "hi there, is there anything you'd like to talk about today? \n",
      "Yes, I am feeling very anxious about my school work lately. \n",
      "I see, so your main worry is about academic pressure? \n",
      "Is there a specific aspect that you are focusing on? \n",
      "Yes, I am focusing on my grades and the pressure I feel from my mom.\n",
      "Have you been performing below your normal standard this year? \n",
      "she wants me to get all A's. I feel she has too high of expectations sometimes, which makes me feel like I need to perfect my assignments and spend all this time on them.\n",
      "No, I do well, it just causes me a great amount of stress.\n",
      "I hear you, I have been in a similar situation. Parents sometimes do not realise just how much pressure they are putting on their children to be perfect. \n",
      "I feel like as long as I am meeting the requirements and am passing, she should be proud of my accomplishments. \n",
      "She should be proud I am even going to college.\n",
      "Exactly! there is nothing at all wrong with not being a straight A student. \n",
      "Have you tried to tell her how you feel about her behaviour and attitude towards your studies? \n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly. I feel like there is this society stereotype of needing straight A's otherwise you are a failure or something.\n",
      "A bit, but she uses the \"I pay for your education\" card.\n",
      "Which makes sense, but still, I know I am doing well so it's just a lot at times.\n",
      "Absolutely not. There is nothing wrong with not being perfect. And she has no right to emotionally manipulate you by mentioning money. \n",
      "I agree, but she does have money over my head, which sucks.\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, I am very grateful for her financial support, but she uses it to manipulate me at times.\n",
      "Are there any scholarships or hardship funds that you could potentially look into applying for? \n",
      "Yes, I have received multiple scholarships, but nothing that will make a dent in the tuition. \n",
      "College is too expensive.\n",
      "Ah, it is very expensive isn't it? I understand, I am still paying off my loans! But it should be worth it in the end. One day you could get a job working for Amazon! \n",
      "That's what I keep telling myself, but I have this overarching fear that I will be in debt forever then.\n",
      "Debt is a very scary thing to experience, I know. I do worry a lot about it sometimes too so you are not alone. \n",
      "That makes me feel better.\n",
      "The main thing is, do you enjoy your studies and consider them worthwhile? \n",
      "yes, somewhat, but who loves school?\n",
      "I really did enjoy University .. I made a lot of friends and it was a good learning experience. I hope you feel a bit the same? \n",
      "Somewhat, but all I feel I have time for is the school work\n",
      "\n",
      "not the social aspect so much\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that you need to be easier on yourself. Do you have many friends? \n",
      "Are you able to confide in your friends about your situation and your worries? \n",
      "Yes at times, which makes things a little better in the moment.\n",
      "Do you feel that your friends are able to empathise with your situation? Are any of them going through the same thing? \n",
      "they all have more independence and pay for their own things, so they can't really relate to me. That is where I feel behind in life than everyone else.\n",
      "Would it be possible for you to get a part time job of some description? Maybe bar tending or working in a restaurant? \n",
      "That gives me social anxiety, which is something I also struggle with greatly. \n",
      "Ah I suffer from terrible social anxiety myself so I hear you \n",
      "I hope I have been able to provide you with some useful advice! \n",
      "i cant go back to uni due to finacial issue\n",
      "Good afternoon. How may I assist you?\n",
      "What is unit? Are talking school\n",
      "as i stated i had to cut university short and i feel like am going to finish old\n",
      "What age are You?\n",
      "and i feel like school is my best chance to be someone and get out of the life we are in\n",
      "I understand your dilemma. I am in my 60s and desiring my degree as well \n",
      "oh do you feel like you under achieved like you do better\n",
      "The COVID has put a lot of students is a bind. \n",
      "maybe but this is not the first time prosponding\n",
      "No I want to study a certain field. For better understanding of the Bible. \n",
      "oh that sounds great. sometimes i feel like God is my only ally and friend\n",
      "have you ever heard the phrase you are never to old to learn?\n",
      "Yes He truly stands by you.\n",
      "i just hope he holds me through this too, i give myself hope that he let this happen for a reason\n",
      "\n",
      "I started going to college in 94 and still going. \n",
      "He will see you through just keep a positive attitude.\n",
      "what is your field of study?\n",
      "i think i would have given up or asked God what's his purpose with me cause i cant see it\n",
      "computer engineering and information technology\n",
      "I know what I am after, just have to be persistent. \n",
      "That is a good choice of study. \n",
      "i guess so. i pray i get that too, and not give up easily\n",
      "Are you full time\n",
      "\n",
      "but next year am considering part time\n",
      "What about online classes that enable you to study and work also.\n",
      "pick up work. i had a scholarship but it got cancelled when my grades dropped a bit\n",
      "There are classes you can take that can fit your schedule\n",
      "that's the plan next year. I have 2 more years to go\n",
      "But don't give up what you started\n",
      "Take classes now. See what you need and take the classes that will enable you to keep gpoing.\n",
      "i wont though two years seem like forever right now\n",
      "Actually started saving up now for school next year\n",
      "\n",
      "Just never give up. Two years will go by quickly if you keep attending.\n",
      "Look for grants that will assist you. \n",
      "i really will. am going to do my best to get my family out of this place and a better life\n",
      "\n",
      "yea am looking for every possible help i can get. but thank you so much. This was helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "So keep applying yourself and reach for your goals. Have a good day.\n",
      "thank you. Have a blessed day.\n",
      "Hi how can I help you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "hi ..my university is not conducting proper online classes\n",
      "i am very scaring about my education and  subjects and exams \n",

      "thanks for your time too\n",
      "have a nice day \n",
      "Hello. How's it going?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's going well, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm somewhat anxious and distressed because of college. \n",
      "Is there anything specific going on in school that it making you anxious?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I have a large project I must complete for one class, a very important exam for another, and for another my professor is quite incompetent and might cause me to fail that course.\n",
      "Okay, so from what I have read you are anxious because you have a project and an exam going on and you are struggling in another, is that correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is correct. It's caused severe anxiety for me.\n",
      "I can tell just from these few messages how anxious you are about these things.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am currently in college too, and I completely understand the anxiety around your project and your exams. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it's very unfortunate that things turned out this way. I might have the project and exam dealt with, but the one with the incompetent professor makes me want to slam my head on the wall.\n",
      "Have you talked to the professor in the class you are struggling in about ways he can help you learn better? I have found that speaking with my professors when I was struggling and explaining why has helped me in the past. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I have talked with him. Unfortunately, communication is the worst part with him. He will read emails but only selectively respond to some things. I ask him to give me the details for an assignment he never sent the details for and he always ignores it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do\n",
      "n't think he even has the assignment instructions recorded anywhere.\n",
      "Is there anyone in your class that you are close to that you can reach out to?\n",
      "\n",
      "We have a Discord server set up for the class where we're all trying to make sense of the class and our professor because it has been such a bad experience for all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately even that doesn't help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you thought about reaching out to a tutor who has previously taken this course to help with the assignments?\n",
      "\n",
      "It won't work because this professor is \"winging it\" in that he is doing things he never did for the class before, and he is in way over his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mostly because of COVID.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it too late in the semester to drop the course without penalty?\n",
      "\n",
      "It is too late, yes. I wish I had dropped it sooner.\n",
      "Another option I could think of would be to reach out to your advisor and explain the situation with them and explain that everyone is struggling in the class. She may have some options for you, \n",
      "\n",
      "That may be a good idea. I'll consider that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that it would definitely help!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for your help.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very welcome! I am glad you chatted with me tonight!\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad to have talked you as well. Good nigh \n",
      "t(or day).\n",
      "Thank you! You too!\n",
      "\n",
      "hello, how are you?\n",
      "I have been better\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you want to tell me what happened?\n",
      "Well its happening still. I have end of term exams coming up and I have been trying real\n",
      "ly hard to study but I am afraid I will fail my classes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there a reason for you to think that way?\n",
      "I havent done really well on the other tests. I turn in all my work and study hard but I can not seem to pass the exams\n",
      "\n",
      "First of all, try not to overthink right now and do your best to review your materials\n",
      "I have. I have been through the book, read my notes but when i take any practice tests, I still dont do as well as i would like. \n",
      "\n",
      "hmm I understand your frustration, have you talked to your professor about this?\n",
      "No. He was not very kind to me the one time I asked. I felt stupid for asking questions. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so sorry you were treated that way, it's unacceptable\n",
      "How about teaching assistant or your friends? You can form a study group and I've found friends can help even more than teachers\n",
      "That could help. I have a few friends in the class. Im just worried they will also think I am stupid. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh no don't worry  about that,I believe they are understanding and as long as you ask nicely, they'll be more than glad to help you\n",
      "Okay. I think I will do that. Sometimes when my friends answer in class, it helps me understand more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, the problem with teachers is they usually don't see from students' perspective while your fellow students do\n",
      "That is true. I am trying my best and really just want to pass. I think I will study with friends before the test. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are a few free online website that can provide help too, I used to check Khan Academy for concepts I don't understand\n",
      "Oh that is a great idea! I forgot about those. I think that could really help me too.\n",
      "\n",
      "at the same time, you need to make time to relax too, you don't want to overwhelm yourself before the test\n",
      "You're right. Thank you so much I appreciate the help and feel a less anxious now. \n",
      "of course, I hope I could help a bit\n",
      "you did. Have a good evening! Thank you\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I am a bit worried about the academic pressure I am facing\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you mind possibly telling me a bit more about it? I am not all that familiar with that, and it does sound intriguing.\n",
      "I have not done very well in my exams and i'm worried about what my parent's reaction will be when they find out\n",
      "\n",
      "I tend to worry at times too, and it almost always helps to talk about it with someone.\n",
      "Do you usually get along well with your parents?\n",
      "I agree, thank you for being open to talking to me\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I do, but they have invested a lot in my education\n",
      "\n",
      "And I feel that I have let them down\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds to me like you're thinking that you've disappointed your parents by falling behind in class a little?\n",
      "\n",
      "I felt much the same way back when I was in college. My parents paid my way through school, and even got me to pursue a major that I had no interest in.\n",
      "Yes, that is exactly how I feel\n",
      "\n",
      "My parents came from quite a rough background too, and they have sacrificed a lot to get me here\n",
      "\n",
      "I can tell you from personal experience and seeing others who've gone through similar events, your parents just may be a little upset right now, but they love you and really just want you to have a good and happy life. It sounds cheesy, I know, but it is actually true.\n",
      "Thank you, I hope so :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I know it may sound silly, but you may want to start meditating on a regular basis. It truly does make a big difference in the amount of stress and worrying that you will find yourself not doing nearly so often.\n",
      "I've had other people say the same, thank you for the recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll give it a try tonight\n",
      "\n",
      "Studies on the benefits of meditation, mindfulness, and yoga have been pretty definitive in the fact that it drops people's stress levels, and thus their cortisol levels, and makes a real change for the better. I do it myself and it really has worked well for me.\n",
      "That's great! You'll be so glad that you did, I just know it.\n",
      "Please make sure you get back in touch with me to let me know if it was beneficial for you as well.\n",
      "You might also want to consider having an honest conversation about this with your parents. Are you able to have conversations like that with them?\n",
      "I will definitely try and have a conversation with them (after some meditation, of course!)\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for talking to me over these past 15 or so minutes :)\n",
      "\n",
      "You may be surprised at how understanding parents can be when you open up to them\n",
      "Thank you for sharing with me, and I truly hope that it has helped you even just a little. \n",
      "Thank you for sharing with me, and I truly hope that it has helped you even just a little. \n",
      "How are you doing today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am doing well and how are you feeling today?\n",
      "I'm feeling okay today, a bit anxious for my finals this week\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for sharing, feeling anxious days before an exam is a normal. \n",
      "I am also anxious about my upcoming exam this week. \n",
      "What is the exam for?\n",
      "I am preparing to sit to become a clinical counselor. I can relate to feeling anxious. You are not alone. \n",
      "What do you think is triggering your anxiety?\n",
      "I think it might be the fear of failure that triggered it \n",
      "Research has shown that fear of failure does stem from feelings of anxiety, but is it possible to look at fear of failure from a different perspective?\n",
      "I think it might be possible to look at it from a different perspective\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think you can channel your fear of failure into positive energy?\n",
      "I think I probably could\n",
      "\n",
      "How do you think I could do that?\n",
      "\n",
      "You can turn your anxiety into extra energy to plan and prepare.  \n",
      "Having anxiety can give you a boost of energy, which gives you an advantage to achieve your goal.\n",
      "I can probably do that, the anxiety can motivate me to create a studying plan\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, indeed. Having anxiety will keep you anchored to your study plan which would increase your ability to perform well for the exam.   \n",
      "I can do that \n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome! In addition, as you follow your study plan, remember to pace yourself.  \n",
      "I will do that, thank you for your help\n",
      "\n",
      "You are welcome, I hope this session was helpful. \n",
      "It was, thank you\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. How are you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am doing well, thanks for asking! How are you?\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe what's going on?\n",
      "I feel like my university career is a dead end, job-wise. Even though I am a STEM major, I feel like I'm wasting my time putting all this effort into education.\n",
      "What is your career, if you don't mind me asking?\n",
      "I study civil engineering. \n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds like a very difficult major to study. That's a very notable goal!\n",
      "Thank you. Did you ever have to go through a similar kind of experience?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have had a similar experience. I am studying to become a certified optician at the moment. \n",
      "Is there anything in particular that is making you feel this way towards your goal?\n",
      "Probably, the fact that my degree does not make me stand out among other applicants. It is an expectation nowadays. And the fact that I am putting so much resources into it, without the guaranteed payoff, makes me extremely nervous. \n",
      "It sounds like you're worried a lot about your career's future, if that sounds correct?\n",
      "Yes, that's the situation. \n",
      "I think that's a completely normal feeling. It shows that you really care about your future and where you're going.\n",
      "I assume, everyone goes through that to a certain extent. \n",
      "It is! How long have you been studying civil engineering?\n",
      "It's my junior year. So hopefully I'll graduate next year, unless I have to make a victory lap...\n",
      "Hello there, how is life treating you? \n",
      "Hello! Life is treating me fair, what about you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I've been a bit worried this year due to Covid and everything. Have you been worrying about anything? \n",
      "Yes, not covid tho. Mostly, it's academics. It paralyses me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you work in academia then? Or are you a student? \n",
      "I am a college student, and I miss my high school days.\n",
      "So you feel that life was more simple when you were still in high school? \n",
      "Yes, schoolwork wise. Now, I can never stay on top. \n",
      "I think that it is quite usual to feel a bit disorientated when transitioning from school to college. It is strange to feel like an adult all of a sudden \n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have any experience with that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I do. It took me quite a long time to adjust to college in my first year too. \n",
      "Woah, I am sorry it was rough for you. \n",
      "It was a bit but I think that it was not just me. It's a huge life change. Is your problem mainly with your grades or are there other issues? \n",
      "\n",
      "I would say my grades is the most important part of my llife, so it's the only thing that worries me\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you feel scared that you might fail your exams? \n",
      "All the time. I didn't fail any this semester, but the anxiety makes me irritable and worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are personal tutors available who could help you with any academic problems you are having? \n",
      "There is no need to feel ashamed that you are not doing as well as you hoped \n",
      "hi there! how are you doing? \n",
      "I feel ashamed thinking of my future career\n",
      "Can you tell me a little about what you feel ashamed about? \n",
      "whenever we have family gathering, my aunts and uncles would brag about how much their children make. I have higher degree but will only make half of their salary so I feel bad\n",
      "So, you feel that your family is judging you for your earning potential? \n",
      "yes, my parents won't say it to me but they never show they're proud either\n",
      "I am very sorry for that. They should be proud that you have such a good degree! \n",
      "What's good if it doesn't translate to my earnings. \n",
      "I wonder if I should start over with some better degree, but it's expensive\n",
      "I think you are coming at this from the wrong perspective. Life is not all about money you know! \n",
      "\n",
      "I want to think otherwise but it's difficult, especially when capitalism is everything nowadays\n",
      "Do you think that you enjoy your current field even though it is not as well paid as it could be? \n",
      "Do you think that you enjoy your current field even though it is not as well paid as it could be? \n",
      "\n",
      "I enjoy it, I did some internship and it was nice\n",
      "I think that you should focus on how much you enjoy it. After all you will be working for the next few decades so you do not want to do something that you hate just because it pays well. \n",
      "Is there anyway for me to change my way of thinking? I keep worrying about all the expense that I'll have to spend and what if I can't afford because of how much I earn\n",
      "Is it possible for you to talk to your parents about this? It seems to me that they  are at the root of your problems \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't really want to talk to them, I'm not very close to them and rarely tell them my problems\n",
      "Well, if you are not close to them does their opinion really count for so much? \n",
      "\n",
      "it still affects me nonetheless\n",
      "I do understand how hard it can be to shake off your family's preconceptions and expectations even though you are not close to them \n",
      "thank you for understanding\n",
      "You are very welcome. Please know that this is a very common problem and a lot of people feel the way that you are feeling now. \n",
      "it's tough when I look around and everyone seems to do better than me\n",
      "Do you think that you might benefit from some counselling to help you overcome your self esteem issues? \n",
      "\n",
      "I've thought about thaat but I'm not in a financial situation to afford that\n",
      "I can provide you with a list of places that will offer a few counselling sessions for free. I think you need to be able to talk this out with a professional. \n",
      "that would be great\n",
      "I think that you need to accept that your parents' opinion should not colour your whole life \n",
      "yeah I should start doing that and not let others affect me\n",
      "Thank you very muchh for talking with me \n",
      "Once your self esteem picks up a little I think that you will find that it's very much easier to ignore other people's input.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very welcome! I wish you well in the months to come. \n",
      "Hello, how are you?\n",
      "Anxious. I'm not sure I can get through this semester\n",
      "\n",
      "What caused your anxiety? Is it because you don't understand your class?\n",
      "No I understand the course work, its just a high pressure environment. Everyone is ranked, so its competitive. \n",
      "\n",
      "it feels like everyone is secrectly angling to take each other down so they can get the good jobs \n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand how you feel being such competitive environment. However, the most important is your well being. I think as long as you do your utmost best, there is no need to stress over rankings\n",
      "The money investment is just so high. I don't want to get out of my 3L year and get a job making barely enough for the loan interest payment\n",
      "\n",
      "I think salary and growth takes more than just academic result. Take one step at a time, take care of your own health and this exam first\n",
      "I've always been hard on myself\n",
      "That's good and bad at the same time, you will always be motivated, however, if you push too much you will burn out yourself\n",
      "Have you reviewed all the materials needed for the exam?\n",
      "I know I can do it its just hard\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah, i think i got it\n",
      "\n",
      "okay, then you are good for the most part. Now just some mental preparation and you will nail it\n",
      "I believe a little worry is good for an exam, however, too much of anything is never good. Practice what you will do in the exam room so you can save as much time as possible\n",
      "It'll be okay. I have a backup plan for after graduation anyways, its just not wanting to have to resort to that\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also intense doing this during COVID. We haven't gotten the normal learning environment for a young attorney in training. We just get a zoom link\n",
      "I understand your frustration, I had a discussion a few days ago about this. Online learning is ok but it can't provide you the same benefits and experience as in person\n",
      "It oddly makes it more competitive too because you don't get the chance to build a relationship with classmates the way we normally would\n",
      "are you close with anyone? You can ask around and see if they want to form a study group\n",
      "No this is my first semester and I moved across the country for this school so I have really no connections here\n",
      "Hello. Thank you for listening to my disunion. \n",
      "you are so welcome. How are you\n",
      "i am okay but i am stressed about this \n",
      "What is stressing you out. Can you help me understand?\n",
      "i got a low pass grade in my college geology class this semester and worry about how this will affect my law school application when i apply \n",
      "That is upsetting and stressful.  I know you are rightfully concerned \n",
      "Can you talk to your geology professor for extra credit?\n",
      "yes i am. do you think it will be ok and what should i do\n",
      "i can’t because the semester is over the and the grades are final. i reached out before about that but she said no \n",
      "I think it is a REAL Concern and you really need to pull that grade up.  It is a very tight race out there and even 1% grade point can make or break you\n",
      "If I were you I would than focus on pulling up all your grades to help avearage out geology course. \n",
      "Maybe contact the lawyer school or someone to do with that area to see what you can do to have a better chance. \n",
      "thank you i appreciate it. i have a fairly high gpa still i have a 3.7 out of 4 but this looks so bad on my transcript lol \n",
      "I know its hard but since this is over and in the past you can't cry over spilt milk so to speak. You can do this!\n",
      "that is a very good idea. i’m just not sure what law school yet bc i’m going to apply to a lot , i’m a sophomore so it’s somewhat far away but not that far away \n",
      "Is there a way you can retake the geology class over?\n",
      "thank u sm!! u rock \n",
      "ya i can but i don’t need to bc it’s unrelated to my majors\n",
      "I have an even better idea actually two... One talk to your college counselor if they offer that to see a plan of action so to speak and two \n",
      "also how’s ur life do u have any stress i can help u talk over  \n",
      "true i will schedule a meeting with my counselor \n",
      "Pray to God some people say prayers is all that is left to do when God should be your first person to run to \n",
      "I appreciate that but that would take several hours and I am here to help you. \n",
      "true God is good \n",
      "yes he is and even thru this pandemic Covid He is on the Throne and  has a purpose\n",
      "how’s the pandemic treating u \n",
      "Trying to take it one day at a time and trying make lemonade out of lemons\n",
      "i feel that it’s miserable but we have to make due just praying i dont get it \n",
      "Its really hard but we are learning to live in the new normal  life as it is and honestly worst is yet to come . We are not to know the future or why God choose it we just have to have hope and believe\n",
      "it’s been 15 min, it was great talking to u today thank u for giving me a plan of action it made me feel much better \n",
      "i agree. u have a blessed day \n",
      "your welcome and it shows 14minu but take care and Keep the faith. I m glad I could help you \n",
      "oops i was looking at the accept HIT timer instead ur right \n",
      "also what’s the bonus for this i forgot lol sorry\n",
      "lol and i don't think u are supposed to say that in the chat . just for future ones. And since its xmas I have a secret.. you can google turk guru. its chrome extension and really helps\n",
      "and support person needs to close out the talk\n",
      "omg i’m so sorry, but yes thank you sooo much i will def use that. merry christmas and may God bless you and your family  \n",
      "Hi! How are you doing today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm ok I guess, but I'm pretty stressed out.\n",
      "Can you tell me more about that?\n",
      "I have a final exam tomorrow, and it has me really stressed out. If I don't get at least a B I'm not going to pass this class.\n",
      "I can definitely understand why that would be stressful. Do you have anyone to help you study?\n",
      "I do. There is a study group of people in my class. I am preparing really well but I've struggled with this class so much that I still get really worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like you are preparing well but are still worried that it won't be enough. Does that sound right?\n",
      "Yes, that's right. I feel like I could literally study 24 hours a day and it won't be enough. It's hard to know if the information is really getting into my head, and if I'm actually understanding it all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes taking a break and clearing your mind, taking a few deep breaths, can help people calm down. Is that something you can do?\n",
      "I have tried that. And it does kind of help in the moment. It's when I get back to studying that all of the anxiety sets in. And it gets worse as it gets closer to the test. If I'm not studying, I feel guilty that I'm taking a break.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that. I have felt the same way before. But I realized I don't have to feel guilty for taking a break. It's important for my mental health.\n",
      "And I try to remember that, too. And I know that's right. But in the moment I feel guilty, so it's so hard for me to relax taking a break.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just in the conversation I can see how stressed out you are and struggling with how to handle that.\n",
      "Yes. Once my head is in this stressful mode, it's hard to break free.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes talking with a close friend can help. Have you tried that?\n",
      "I have. And that does help in the moment. It's always when I get back into the actual studying that it's a problem. I think getting the test over with is the only thing that will help.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like the actual studying is what is causing you to be stressed. Does that seem to be true?\n",
      "Yeah, definitely. I'm just worried about the test.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you have done everything you can to be prepared for the test. And know a few strategies to help you cope with your stress. I think you will feel much better once it's over!\n",
      "Ok! It sounds like this helped!\n",
      "It did - thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "hello, I need some help\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, tell me all do you want to say!\n",
      "I'm just really nervous about my fnial\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to get a really high grade, a 95, in order.  to pass the class\n",
      "\n",
      "ohhh, but don't worry. do your best effort and you will get 95\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm trying hard, but I just feel so much pressure\n",
      "\n",
      "I work 2 jobs to pay for school,  and failing. is not an option\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you should don't be nervous, because it rest to your concentration!\n",
      "What do you suggest I do?  I've been studying all night\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh God, I can understand you! that's a lot of pressuare\n",
      "Should I keep studying or try and get some rest?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I think you should take a rest time from your works and take that time to study a lot.\n",
      "my test is tomorrow! I'm not working right now, I'm studying\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes of course, You can do it and keeping studying to do your best in the exam\n",
      "OHHHH!!!! well, you can take a rest like 20 or 30 minutes to desestress yourself and then continuing studying all night \n",
      "how do I take some pressure off myself?\n",
      "that's a good idea!\n",
      "\n",
      "after the exam your pressure will be less than now\n",
      "True.  Do you have any study tips?\n",
      "\n",
      "tomorrow will be a good day for you! I CAN SEE YOUR GRADE IT WILL BE 95\n",
      "what if I fail? I will be miserrable\n",
      "\n",
      "when i am studying i practices a lot everything, special the things that are more difficult \n",
      " I always started with the difficult things, when I understood those parts I pass to the most simple parts, I think is better for my comprehension\n",
      "those are good suggestions!\n",
      "\n",
      "DON'T THINK THAT, you are trying and you can't give up now, I AM SURE YOU WILL PASS!\n",
      "this made me feel less stressed \n",
      "\n",
      "You are always welcome! \n",
      "have a good night!\n",
      "\n",
      "that's good, you have to eliminate your stress because it rest to your energy and good vibes \n",
      "I'm going to get some rest\n",
      "\n",
      "study a lot please! don't give up. \n",
      "Hi, is there something bothering you that prompted you to send a message?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, are you still with me?\n",
      "Yes I am feeling bad about myself. I am unemployed from the Pandemic.  I decided to back to school and it is a lot harder than i anticipated.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a scholarship and Im not working so I should be successful, right?\n",
      "\n",
      "But I feel distracted, it is online and there is a lot of writing assignments.  I feel like I dont know what they expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds like a stressful situation.\n",
      "I have also struggled with staying focused while working from home.\n",
      "Have you tried making a designated study area?\n",
      "I am running out of money too and it isnt helping me to focus.  I thought I could be productive and do something positive during this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a desk in my bedroom.  My 3 kids are in college too, LOL.\n",
      "I wish there were some face to face or zoom like participation classes.  I dont like independant study.\n",
      "It sounds like you are trying very hard to change your situation during this crazy year.\n",
      "Is there a way to connect with other students taking the same classes?\n",
      "\n",
      "If not maybe you could initiate a zoom study/discussion group.\n",
      "Not really.  I was wondering that too.  We have assignment where we \"post\" and \"respond\" to some topic or other.  Yeah I think that is a good idea.\n",
      "I like that idea, i think i will ask my kids how to set that up\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish you much luck in your continuing education. I know that you can find a way to connect with other students and succeed!\n",
      "Thank you for your understanding, it is good to bounce things off someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a great day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, I hope you do too!\n",
      "hi there, how are you and how can i help?\n",
      "not too bad but like i said\n",
      "\n",
      "im going into university and my parents want to me to do architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "when im really into engineering \n",
      "\n",
      "money is a large factor so-\n",
      "\n",
      "i see. are your parents paying for your university?\n",
      "well money as in like salaries later on\n",
      "\n",
      "tuition fees aren't an issue im in canada and all\n",
      "\n",
      "but like architects generally make more money than mechanical engineers on average\n",
      "\n",
      "so they don't approve my career path\n",

      "oh i see. so you mean that your parents would prefer you to choose the path that will eventually give you a higher salary?\n",
      "but i don't like architecture very much, i don't find myself fond of art\n",
      "\n",
      "that is a tough situation. it's definitely not easy to go against your family's wishes, but at the same time you have to do what's best for you\n",
      "well what's best for me is literally a good salary because i'd be lying if money isn't an issue\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "but am i going to be happy later on doing the job?\n",
      "\n",
      "i went through a similar experience during my schooling, and i had to explain to my parents that i don't want to disappoint them but i still have to do what makes me happy. having a career that you hate doesn't feel good - i've been there\n",
      "but there can be careers in engineering that have connections to architecture as well, such as structural engineering\n",
      "it's much more suitable if i could mix up the details of each career paths\n",
      "\n",
      "but frankly i don't think my parents should be concerned with engineering either\n",
      "\n",
      "it pays well and provides good stability\n",
      "\n",
      "but like they said architecture suits my strengths more and i can go further with it\n",
      "\n",
      "honestly i think both are great career paths to pursue and as you said, both are stable and well-paying fields\n",
      "strengths doesn't always equal happiness though, so that's a tough one.\n",
      "have you considered speaking with both architects and engineers to learn more about each job? that might be helpful in your decision. sometimes what we think a job does, in actuality can be totally different in real life\n",
      "i went on reddit to ask students in my desired uni\n",
      "\n",
      "and they all said that what they are doing is what you expect\n",
      "\n",
      "architects said it's a booming business in Toronto\n",
      "\n",
      "engineers is always in demand, but not growing\n",
      "\n",
      "ah well i commend you on taking that step and actually trying to learn about the jobs. you seem like a really smart person and you're able to see things from a logical perspective\n",
      "thank you i've done the research to dispute my parents' arguments you see\n",
      "\n",
      "utimately its about how much i like it o not\n",
      "\n",
      "i think what you need to do is take that same logical approach and explain calmly to your parents the path you want to take. just because they think your strengths are suited for architecture, doesnt mean you don't also have the strengths for engineering. many of the same skills are probably required for both jobs, and you're right: ultimately it is about what will make you happy\n",
      "and worst case scenario: you can always change careers later if you find that you don't like what you're doing\n",
      "yeah you are absolutely right\n",
      "\n",
      "but about the careers path\n",
      "\n",
      "not sure if you're in canada or not, but it's much harder to switch careers in canada\n",
      "\n",
      "you pay more and it's not like in the States where you can finish your degree whenever you want right\n",
      "\n",
      "you sound like a good student and i'm sure your parents must recognize that you're capable of great things, so if you can present to them a logical argument of why you feel engineering is a better path, hopefully they will listen. \n",
      "yeah that is the plan\n",
      "\n",
      "you're been extremely helpful and im grateful for that\n",

      "\n",
      "I have a big essay due on Monday and I can’t bring myself to write it \n",
      "I completely understand I've been there myself, finding motivation can be so hard, but I know you can do it! \n",
      "what have you done so far? Do you have some of the assignment done?\n",
      "\n",
      "How did you get motivated? Do you have any advice?\n",
      "I always thought of my GPA and how a single grade could affect all of my hard work. Perhaps thinking of what this grade can affect will motivate you to really avoid any stressful situations it may bring.\n",
      "Yeah to be fair this is a big part of my degree so I can’t not do it. I just find the subject so hard compared to some of the other ones I’ve done so far. It’s a lot of maths which I suck at \n",
      "I have been there, I major in Biotechnology engineering. Image what life will be like once you are finished with this nightmare assignment. Give it your all. Find that fire inside of you and push through. You are almost there, remember everything you have overcome, dont let this little hurdle set you back. I have faith in you!\n",
      "Right now, dive into the subject, find outside resources. Hustle time. the great always struggle towards the end, you are one of those great! remind yourself of what you can do and have overcome.\n",
      "Wow, biotech engineering must have been cool. Makes my economics module seem a bit silly now haha. I think I’m just getting frustrated with myself which is annoying in itself when I know deep down I probably could do it if I stopped trying to avoid it \n",
      "oh no! my best friend has a business major and economics class almost killed her. she took it FOUR times before she passed it. She never gave up! this is your dream, chase it, own it, and conquer it.\n",
      "I am the champion of getting frustrated. I take a breather and come back. Always come back. take a nap or do something you enjoy doing. \n",
      "I’m glad I’m not the only one who struggles with economics although I definitely don’t want to have to retake it haha. I guess I will have to retake it if I don’t actually do the work though! \n",
      "I think even just being here is procrastinating really when I should be writing my essay! \n",
      "My poor friend, economics in itself is a beast that only unique minds understand. But, I do believe that with effort and dedication. She will be so mad for telling someone else how many times she fail the class. You can do it! you are at the end!\n",
      "\n",
      "get to work and make it happen!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah I think you’re right. I think we have a minute or so left here and then I’m just going to put my headphones in and get it done. You’ve been really helpful today, I needed someone else to tell me to just get on with it today so thank you \n",
      "It’s been the push I needed!\n",
      "Enjoy the rest of your day, take care! \n",
      "Hi! How are you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Im really nervous about my upcoming finals :/\n",
      "Finals can be so stressful. Have you been studying?\n",
      "I keep trying, but it seems my nervousness from wanting to do well is clouding my mind and making it hard to study \n",
      "\n",
      "I can imagine. When i was in school , i had the same thing happen to me. I was so sterssed, it led to me nto being able to focus. \n",
      "What really helped me was practicing mindfulness. \n",
      "Are there any exercies that you like doing?\n",
      "I like to lift weights for gaining muscle mass. Usually pushups are my favorite bodyweight exercise\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you made time to do that latey?\n",
      "I havent really no, should I?\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely, exercise is a really good way to de-stress. It releases endorphins which can calm you and make you happy. This is a great way to reset before studying. \n",
      "That is a good tip, I should really start working on that more. What could I do to help me study more efficiently though?\n",
      "\n",
      "HAve you tried setting small study goals? That always helps me. I set a hour for one small topic at a time , it makes studying less overwhelming. \n",
      "Okay, so If i have 6 finals, would I be able to study for all by studying less?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not necessarily studying less but break the 6 finals into smaller tasks. Use index cards to organize yourself. I alwyas start with an outline of topics i need to cover then put them onto index cards. \n",
      "I really like that, I should definitly start doing that. How about work school balance, I currently work and am enrolled full time. Should I request time off to prep for finals or what should I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "That's up to you. WIll your employer be accommodating about taking a day or two off? You want to make sure to not lose your job. \n",
      "Thats a good point. I really like my job so I wouldnt like to lose it. But I feel like I should ask anyways. I mean the worst they can say is no right?\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely, worth a try. \n",
      "Thank you so much for your help, you have been great. Have a good day\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy to help!! have a great day. \n",
      "It is finals week at my college and I'm beyond anxious about it (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking finals certainly is tough, there's so much to think about. What's bothering you the most?\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably my stamina and endurance to finish all the work.  I'm still recovering from Covid-19 (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you spoken to anyone at the college about this?\n",
      "Yes, but they haven't been much help unfortunately.  My classes are online and finals are due when finals are due.  They are not giving any wiggle room (3)\n",
      "\n",
      "It must make you feel quite trapped knowing that the college aren't cutting you a bit of slack considering you are still recovering from a serious illness. It sounds like you are trying your best and not giving up already.\n",
      "\n",
      "No I cannot give up at all.  My scholarship requires me to maintain a certain GPA and I can't afford to lose it (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "It's good to hear that you're not giving up. Sometimes in these situations, you just have to do your best and then at least you know you did what you could. I like to tell myself in these situations that if there are no other avenues to explore, you just have to 'go with the flow' and don't beat yourself up thinking about it over and over - if there's nothing you can do, just do your best to ride it out\n",
      "I know, there is just so much riding on these finals.  I have great grades so I'm praying that I pass without any issues and that I don't bomb even one of them (5)\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you still there?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you tried hard previously then you may come out the other end having done very well!  When I was at school a long time ago, I had to stay off school for a month, when they were practising the exams. I didn't get chance to do those and I thought 'wow I'm totally screwed here', but guess what? I did okay!\n",
      "I hope that's what happens, I just don't know how to calm down about it (6)\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you know any techniques to help me calm down? (7)\n",
      "\n",
      "It's totally understandable. I think even without the COVID situation, you would still be anxious. It's totally natural. Not that that discounts how you feel. Do you agree?\n",
      "Yes, that is true.  I just can't quite seem to quiet my mind. (8)\n",
      "Well, I've tried meditating a few times before which doesn;t take it all away, it just takes the edge off! I used a guided meditation app. I also listened to white noise when I went to sleep as I was having trouble sleeping. I find even if you're mind is just taken away from it all for a few minute, it can re-balance you a little\n",
      "\n",
      "I've tried watching some comedy shows and listening to music to take my mind off of it.  It works sometimes (9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe you should do more of that, it sounds like a good idea? Don't feel guilty for doing so either as it acts as a 'medicine'. If the 'medicine' works then take it\n",
      "I will try to focus more on that when I'm not studying and see if it keeps helping then (10)\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds like a plan! It's certainly worth giving it a go. We need a break from it all sometimes or we'd all go mad.\n",
      "Hello, I'm sorry I didn't reply faster.\n",
      "How can I help?\n",
      "How can I help?\n",
      "It's okay. Thank you for replying.\n",
      "So I have some issues with time management.\n",
      "I understand. What are you struggling with concerning time management? \n",
      "I have also struggled with time management. I have found that reminders on my phone, and a planner have been most beneficial to me personally. I understand every situation is different. Do you have a deadline you're trying to meet?\n",
      "I am trying to manage having my kids's learn virtually at home, while I'm completing my Master's, and working at night. I feel like I have to drop my Master's because it all seems like too much.\n",
      "I have used those tools. With the current environment in the world, I feel like dealines are a waste of time. I'm trying to go with the flow and just set daily goals.\n",
      "I can see how this would be very overwhelming. I have a child learning virtually as well. Similarly, I am a student. I am not working on my masters degree... I can't even imagine. \n",
      "So you understand how the virtual learning has affected the day to day goals? I used to work during the day, complete my school work when the kids are in bed, but now everything seems so stressful.\n",
      "Is your child old enough to do some of it on their own? I have \"independent\" or \"together\" next to each task. I purchased a large magnetic chalk board for our fridge. If your child is to young to do this I could see how this would be much more challenging for you.\n",
      "That's a great idea! Two of my kids are old enough to work independently most of the time, they are 11 and 8. However, I also have a 3 year old that requires constant attention. Unfortunately, her daycare is closed. Even more, I had to take on my nephew because his mother could not handle the virtual learning.\n",
      "I completely understand how you feel. Virtual learning has affected our daily goals, though we are doing prerecorded lessons. That does make it easier I am sure. I have a 10 and 2 year old at home with me. One thing that has helped me is support groups. There are so many moms going through the same thing we are at this time.\n",
      "I never even thought of support groups. It would help to connect with other moms, just to remind myself that I am not alone in this. Thank you so much. You also have a busy bee on your hands! \n",
      "You are not alone in this. You could take the 3 year old to another room if possible and work on phonics/numbers, then help the older children during naptime. Then maybe they could help entertain the 3 year old while you work on your own schoolwork? This is similar to my daily schedule... but as you know with kids you have to go with the flow most of the time.\n",
      "Definitely have to go with the flow. They make life wondefully unpredictable. Thank you and those are fantastic ideas. I'll have to create a naptime, that would be the most helpful.\n",
      "It helps so much to talk to other moms who understand. Being a mom is hard enough without all the added extra stress of 2020. It sounds like you're doing the best you can, and your kids will remember that in the long run. You can do this!\n",
      "Thank you so much for the wonderful advice. I will be looking into support groups, 2020 has definitely been a shake up for the whole world. I truly appreciate your support! Your kids are blessed to have you.\n",
      "Hello, how are you doing today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am okay just anxious\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand anxiety in these times, is there something specific that's bothering you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe i am going to fail all my finals for college\n",
      "\n",
      "College finals are a stressful time for sure, I'm sure you're doing your best to prepare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes i have been studying for hours everyday. sometimes it is hard to focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes it's best to take a short break to reset when you feel like your gears are grinding.\n",
      "\n",
      "that is true, but i feel guilty when i take breaks\n",
      "\n",
      "I often feel the same way when I'm not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus\n",
      "\n",
      "You sounds pretty stressed about it, make sure you're getting enough sleep so you don't get run down.\n",
      "\n",
      "do sleep for at least 10 hours\n",
      "\n",
      "i also take 20 minute power naps because i have read somewhere it helps\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there someone you could study with to help break up how you're studying?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes i live with a roommate and we are in the same program, but i sometimes feel dumb when i study with her\n",
      "\n",
      "Try not to think of yourself that way. I'm sure you both provide a benefit to each other while studying.\n",
      "\n",
      "it is fun when we study together, \n",
      "\n",
      "i also forget to eat sometimes because im so stressed\n",
      "\n",
      "I also felt that way around finals and with friends, I think it's important to recognize this is one semester and that it's equally as important to take care of yourself as it is to pass those finals.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also felt that way around finals and with friends, I think it's important to recognize this is one semester and that it's equally as important to take care of yourself as it is to pass those finals.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes thats the only thing that is keeping me going. This is only for a few days and it will soon end and i will have a break\n",
      "\n",
      "It will get better, this is just now and there's a lot to look forward once you're through this. Make sure you're taking care of yourself first and foremost. That will ultimately provide you success.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't wait to be successful one day, but the thought of working also sc\n",
      "ares me. I fell be by myself. \n",
      "thank you so much, I feel relieved. I will take all your suggestions into consideration. \n",
      "\n",
      "From what I've seen, you're not alone in that feeling. It's a natural fear for just about anyone approaching something new. But there really aren't any rules, your life and your decisions decide your success.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm glad you're feeling relieved. Your feelings are relevant and completely natural. Just make sure to take care of yourself first and foremost, that's the most important thing.\n",
      "finals are this week and i'm freaking out!\n",
      "\n",
      "That must be so stressful!! Have you started studying?\n",
      "Yes, I've been studying for weeks now.  But some of my professors give the oddest quizzes that seem to not match anything we've worked on! (2)\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember when i was in school, finals were always so stressful. I used to make sure that i took breaks, it really helped me keep my head on straight. \n",
      "yeah, I can do that at times.  But I also work part-time while I'm in school.  I guess I should have planned ahead and taken this week off. (3)\n",
      "You can even find time to relax without taking a lot of time off, do you have any exercise you like doing?\n",
      "not really.  I had Covid last month and my dr told me not to do anything more than walking for 3 months while my lungs and body recover.  So that's hard (4)\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh wow, i'm so sorry to hear that! How are you feeling now?\n",
      "I'm ok.  But extremely tired.  The dr said the fatigue could take months to go away.  So it's a struggle with work and school. (5)\n",
      "Have you tried meditating or mindfulness? When i broke my leg and couldn't exercise, it really helped me relax. \n",
      "I'm sure! I'm very impressed that you are still wroking and in school despite being sick. You should feel proud of yourself \n",
      "I have not.  I pray a lot and that does help.  Honestly it's the only relief I've gotten lately.  I have three more finals and a paper due by Friday.\n",
      "Praying is helpful! Mindfulness goes very hand in hand with it, if you look online, there are tons of free midnfulness classes and guides. I think it could really help you especially before a test. \n",
      "I will look into it.  I had to go back to work before I was ready because I was out for 3 weeks with Covid.  And school is mostly all online so at least I don't have to go in (7)\n",
      "That's really hard but i'm happy that you can stay home at least. HAve you been able to sleep and rest?\n",
      "yes my parents are making sure of that!  I'm lucky to have them.  I just need to calm down about this - it is what it is.(8)\n",
      "That's great! Family is the best medicine for being sick and stressed. \n",
      "That is very true!  I would have been so scared had my mom not been here when I had covid.(9)\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you get to talk to your parents often? \n",
      "Yes, I still live at home :)  So pretty much every day!  If I can just get through this week I'll be able to rest a lot better I think. (10)\n",
      "That's lucky! You;ll be great. Just be positive and study as best as you can. Since you've already been studying, you'll do great!\n",
      "have you ever failed a test?\n",
      "I failed a driving test once\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "how did it make you feel?\n",
      "\n",
      "I was very aggravated. I thought it was the instructor's fault. I was 15.\n",
      "I failed a math test, and was really depressed about this situation. it was my final. I barely passed the class. the teacher graded ont he curve.\n",
      "\n",
      "I failed the written part of the driving test when i was 16, i was upset about that as well. took 3 times to pass it\n",
      "\n",
      "so, did you ever pass the test\n",
      "\n",
      "right, but still it was a hard pill to swallow knowing that i didn't pass it on my own, i needed the weight of the class to pull me up\n",
      "\n",
      "I did. On my second try. But, take heart. You tried your best and you are continuing to try hard. It's wise to keep in touch with how you're feeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was, and I am still feeling really upset about passing on my on. I currently enrolled in another math class. Im hoping that this ends differently. \n",
      "I find that sometimes some breathing exercises, getting fresh air, can help clear your head. \n",
      "I guess I can try that, i usually just eat and avoid my math work until the last minute. I am an emotional eater.\n",
      "taking long walks as well. Don't obsess on it.\n",
      "i like walking my dog, that usually gives me sometime to reflect and to stay optimistic about math. I have a great family support because my family knows how much I want to become a math teacher.  \n",
      "Thanks for all the positive advice. \n",
      "You certainly got your work cut out for you.\n",
      "i know thats why im so stress. \n",
      "Perhaps \"teacher\" is the right path, buth \"math\" is not. good Luck to you\n",
      "Hi, how are you?  \n",
      "I'm stressed out about my finals coming up. \n",
      "Let me make sure I understand.  Your feeling stressed about your finals.\n",
      "I understand what that is like.  What is your biggest fear?\n",
      "I think I'm most scared that I'm going to study a lot but not do well and then not get good grades in my classes. \n",
      "Did the teacher provide you with a study guide?  \n",
      "Only one of them did. I have a total of 4 finals.\n",
      "Okay, are you familiar with their testing style?  I am assuming you have had other test in these classes.\n",
      "Yes thankfully I have. In all my classes, I have had tests before. I'm still nervous though. \n",
      "I can tell you are stressed, try to relax, are you in a study group?\n",
      "no, I don't really like studying with other people. I do have some friends in the classes though.\n",
      "They are all probably feeling the same way.  Try not letting fear fail you.  Study hard and be confident, you have made it this far, your almost done.\n",
      "Thank you for your kind words! I will take that into consideration. \n",
      "also make sure you get enough rest, exercise and eat well balanced meals.  That will help you feel less stressed.\n",
      "Those are very good things I will do. \n",
      "Thank you for your help!\n",
      "your gonna do great.  your welcome.\n",
      "have a nice day - bye!\n",
      "I think you need to respond once more\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, can I discuss an issue with you?\n",
      "Yes please. What has been bothering you?\n",
      "My parents, they expect me to always get straight A's.\n",
      "oh wow. Is that hard for you? Explain what's upsetting you about that. \n",
      "It is upsetting because it is an expectation.  I am not perfect and I always try my hardest.  I am afraid of not being perfect.\n",
      "I've also struggled with the same thing. My parents put that pressure on me so I understand that. \n",
      "Do you tell your parents you're trying your best? What do they say?\n",
      "They tell me it is my only job.  They think it will help pay for college if I am the best.\n",
      "It sounds like that expectation is very hard on you and makes you anxious\n",
      "That's okay to feel that way!\n",
      "Thanks, I just don't want to disappoint them. They work so hard and want the best for me.\n",
      "Deep down they really just want you to succeed. But that doesn't mean it isn't difficult for you. I'm sure you're doing your best.\n",
      "Have you talked to them about the pressure/expectation?\n",
      "I am, I told my sister to not get straight a's or they will always expect it.  I h ave not talked to them\n",
      "I would suggest talking to them about the expectation. You could say something like, \"I want you guys to realize that I am trying my best but when you put this expectation on me and makes me even more stressed out\"\n",
      "Okay, I can try that, it makes me very anxious.  Would writing a letter be okay?\n",
      "That is a scary conversation to have. I think the letter idea is a great idea!\n",
      "I am better at expressing my feelings that way.  \n",
      "I'm better writing things down too. \n",
      "Writing that should hopefully let them see what is going on. I think it will work. \n",
      "I hope it will work, maybe I will write it and leave it in the morning for them to find after I go to school.  That way they can think about what I said and not just react. \n",
      "That's an even better idea. Great thinking!\n",
      "Thanks, you have made me feel a lot better.  \n",
      "I'm glad. I hope it all works out for you!\n",
      "I'm stressed about my finals :(\n",
      "\n",
      "When is your finals?\n",
      "They are in 1.5 weeks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Have you reviewed all of your materials?\n",
      "I'm just getting started with doing that for three of my classes. One of my other classes I have already been studying for about a week. \n",
      "As long as you prepare, you shouldn't be too worried about it\n",
      "Yes but I'm still anxious that I won't prepare enough and I'll get bad grades\n",
      "\n",
      "You are only 1.5 weeks away from the exam, the only thing you can do right now is studying as hard as you can. There's no point worrying\n",
      "So as long as you try your best, you already did everything you could\n",
      "I will try and study really hard the next couple days then\n",
      "\n",
      "Howeve, i would use the last day before the finals to relax and avoid overwhelming your brain\n",
      "ohh that's a good idea. thank you! I'll do some relaxing activities that day\n",
      "\n",
      "with that short of a time, maybe you should ask your friends and go over main points together\n",
      "that would be smart too. I can do that for two classes but not the other two because i don't know people in those classes\n",
      "then do it as much as you can, as for the classes that impossible, you can study by yourself . If you pay attention and study hard, i have no doubt you'll ace this exam\n",
      "thank you! i really appreciate the help you have given me\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm glad I could be some help\n",
      "have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, how can I help you?\n",
      "Not sure if I should return to school during covid\n",
      "\n",
      "your school doesn't offer remote learning?\n",
      "It does, but typically we have study groups in person which I find very helpful\n",
      "you can still do that online instead of in person\n",
      "My am anxious I will do poorly with out the study groups\n",
      "I understand how you may feel that way, it's easy to feel anxious when something you do so frequently  gets taken away\n",
      "The school is expensive and I dont want to have to redo a class if I am not passing.  I ended up stopping school last time because Covid started, but its been almost a year, and I feel that I will never finish if I dont go back during spring semester.\n",
      "Your worry is very understandable, have you talked to your professors about that to see what they can help?\n",
      "I have not because I am not currently enrolled.  I have talked to admissions who said I can wait or restart when ever I wish.  \n",
      "that sounds great. I find that your mindset is very important, you can only finish great if you feel at ease. Why don't you just wait and study on your own first, and officially start when you feel reassured?\n",
      "My only concern on waiting is how long do I wait?  It does not seem like COVID is going away any time soon.  In fact the number of cases in California where I live are rising substancially.  I cant advance in my career if I dont get a degree, so its such a double edged sword!\n",
      "How about create an online study group with your friends if you need to get a degree in time. Either Zoom or Skype is user friendly\n",
      "Dont you have to pay for those?\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh no, you don't even have to install Zoom. I have been in a lot of Zoom conference where I simply access through the link they give me\n",
      "well that sounds reassuring.\n",
      "yeah, so don't be too pessimistic. There are always solutions. Other than group study, are there any reasons you worry about school?\n",
      "Well money of course, but thats what financial aid is for.  My biggest worry was how to collaborate and study in a world where we cant get together\n",
      "if you prefer to be able to discuss in person, how about do an in person meeting at the park or open space? That way you can keep your distance \n",
      "Thanks for your input, it gives me a different perspective to think about, and would present some options I hadnt thought about.\n",
      "you have a good night, i appreciate the advise.\n",
      "\n",
      "No problems, I'm glad I could be some help\n",
      "Hi.  I am worried about my exams.\n",
      "Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "Exams are a stressful time. What seems to be the problem?\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not feel like I am properly prepared, even though I have studied.  \n",
      "I can assure you that countless students including myself have gone through the trials of studying for exams and do feel overwhelmed but it passes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have studied.  However, I still feel like I am not prepared.  One big problem is that I have no quiet place to study.  \n",
      "I get it, distractions can be challenging to overcome at times. Have you thought about going to a library, or a book store?\n",
      "I have not.  Both of those are great suggestions.  I wonder if I should take the time to walk to the library (30 minutes), or just continue to study?  Maybe, I know as much as I can know.  The anxiety is too much.\n",
      "If it helps you study then the library may be worth the time and effort. Sometimes we can stress out over worrying about not having enough time to study. But trust the work you have done and you will know if it is enough.\n",
      "This is very good advice.  Have you completed college?\n",
      "Yes, and it wasn't easy but with hard work, it is completely doable. And you have the power within yourself.\n",
      "What do you think will happen if I fail this test?\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes it is not about the amount of studying, but the way you study. I like reading my textbooks and highlighting the important parts and then rewriting them so they become ingrained in me. But let us not jump the gun, you haven't failed anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true.  Thanks for reminding me.  I think I worry more about the outcome than I need too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't forget to breathe. Exams are stressful but I would suggest don't cram everything to the last minute. Usually the hour before the exam, I do something else.\n",
      "Very good advice.  Any suggestions on what I can do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Stay calm, believe in yourself, start your studying early so you are not cramming everything in the last few days.\n",
      "But, in the one hour prior to the exam, do you have any advice on something I can do to calm my nerves?\n",
      "\n",
      "Walk outside, away from the students waiting for their tests.\n",
      "Thank you for your help.  I think I will go walk now.  Best regards. \n",
      "Is there anything else I can help you with?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Goodnight and good luck.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so frustrated.\n",
      "\n",
      "May I ask why you are feeling frustrated?\n",
      "Yes, my school was closed without warning because of COVID.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh I understand how that could make you so frustrated, that would make me frustrated too. I am waiting to hear about my school.\n",
      "Yes I don't even know what is going to happen with finals now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them\n",
      "Have you thought about talking to an administrator at your school?\n",
      "I hope so. But I feel like this could have been handled better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not yet, there is a waiting list to talk to an academic advisor.\n",
      "\n",
      "that is all the more reason to be frustrated, i commend you for having to deal with that!\n",
      "Thanks. I feel like my head is going to explode though. The remainder of the semester is going to be online.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you thought about talking to a close friend or someone you trust about these stressors?\n",
      "Yes, I talked with my friend about it and she said don't worry. But I can't help it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand why are you are worried though, that is a lot honestly. \n",
      "I was doing so well in my classes too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very close to graduating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you think that your grades will go down with the switch to online?\n",
      "Yes, I don't do well with online learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have seen that be the case for many people. Hopefully your professors will be understanding with the switch.\n",
      "I hope so too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well I really hope that everything goes well for you! You sound like you are prepared\n",
      "Thank you and thanks for letting me confide in you.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a weird and sad time these days.\n",
      "\n",
      "of course! I hope the rest of your year goes well\n",
      "Thank you so much. And I hope all is well by you too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy the holidays and be safe!\n",
      "How can I help you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I chose a past experience so this will be hypothetical. But I'm looking for ideas for other resources for this course since my professor isn't helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "I see you are looking for some resources on a course that your professor isn't helping you with.  What kind of questions do you have?\n",
      "What other ways can I get help to perform better? Who should I talk to?\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you looking for help to perform better in a certain subject in college?\n",
      "Yeah I am, it's differential equations. Are you able to see the situation description I wrote that has more details?\n",
      "\n",
      "I didn't see all the specifics but I remember taking that class.  I went to my counselor and got a tutor which helped so much.  It was offered for free at the college.  Do you think you that is something you'd like to check out?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah that could be useful. I'm not sure if my school offers that - the math department isn't very good. I'm an engineering major. I wonder if an engineering professor or student could help instead\n",
      "\n",
      "I had a student who was a genius (by my standards) helping me and he was so patient and understanding.  This lessened the pressure and helped me move forward successfully in the class.\n",
      "Yeah that would be helpful. I think I need to hear things a different way. The professor is very confusing, but when I have gotten help from other students the concepts don't seem hard. I just don't do well with his teaching style I guess, it's not that I'm not smart enough to understand. Does that make sense?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things.  \n",
      "Yeah, it can be very stressful when I don't understand though. I'm normally a very good student so it's easy to be hard on myself. But it's good to hear that this is a pretty common experience\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class.  I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that I could rewind and go back to at the time of college.  When I got to grad school, I ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because I could reference the books while listening to a lecture.  That made so much difference.  \n",
      "Yeah that sounds really nice. One of the hardest things was that the professor would never go back and explain what he did, so a problem might be 20 minutes long and if you got confused 3-4 minutes in you were just lost for the rest of it\n",
      "\n",
      "Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.\n",
      "That is actually one thing I'm pretty good at. I'm miserable when I'm tired, so I almost always get 7-8 hours a night.\n",
      "It sounds like you are making efforts to do your best to sleep and understand the materials.  You can give yourself a pat on the back for all the great efforts!\n",
      "Thanks! It's reassuring to know other people felt the same way with this course. Sometimes I felt like I was dumb or lazy because I didn't understand, but it sounds like it's just challenging and those feelings are normal\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes you have to give yourself more credit because you are doing a good job.\n",
      "Yeah, that has always been hard for me, but I'll try to be deliberate about that\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you feel better about the situation?\n",
      "Great, I hope you keep encouraged and working hard toward your goals because you deserve the very best with your hard work.\n",
      "I am, thank you. I feel good, and I think we have completed the requirements of the study, so I am good with wrapping up our chat now if you are\n",
      "\n",
      "Great!  Have a good day.\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I help you today?\n",
      "I'm disgusted with my professors that they don't see me as a human with real emotions and feelings.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that you are feeling like your professors don't see you as a person with feelings. What happened to make you feel this way?\n",
      "I have testing all the time and study non-stop, but the professors don't seem to encourage or support me.  They just see me as a number I feel.\n",
      "That's hard to feel like they are treating you like a number when you are working so hard.  Have you talked to them about it?\n",
      "It's hard to trust them when I'm seen as 1 of 100 people.  If I am struggling they don't flinch or ask me how they can assist.  I just am expected to \n",
      "\n",
      "I had a similar experience in my college days. It was very difficult to have so much pressure to succeed and feel so alone.  You can do though because you are working hard and want to succeed.\n",
      "Thanks for the encouragement.  Where do I start to help myself feel better?\n",
      "I see you are anxious about this when talking to you, but have you thought about getting some support from other students in your position?\n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds like a good idea.  Maybe they are feeling this way too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also sometimes just stepping back and taking some deep breaths can help to alleviate some anxieties. Have you tried that ever?\n",
      "I will have to give that a try.  I've done that in the past and had forgotten just how much that helped me before.  \n",
      "That is reassuring that it worked before for you and  can work again.\n",
      "I'm so worried about failing because I just don't feel the support from my professors to care either way for my successes.  It's so different from high school and home when my parents encouraged me and supported me full-heartedly.  \n",
      "College can be quite a change from the protective atmosphere of home.  Have you tried any support groups or religious groups for encouragement?\n",
      "I am religious so perhaps I could seek a group out and they could help with encouraging me.  \n",
      "I was a  part of a religious group in college and they were very supportive even praying for me on exam days.  I felt they helped me with my success by planting seeds of positive feedback to me.\n",
      "I used to be part of one during high school years, and that sounds like it would help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you starting to feel better about the situation?\n",
      "Yes, I do thinking about other people filling in the gaps and supporting me when others won't or can't. Thanks for chatting.  This was helpful.\n",
      "You are welcome.  I wish you well.\n",
      "I think I have a few tools now to make things better.\n",
      "Hi there, could you please give me some advice? \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, would you like to explain your situation and we can go through  it together\n",
      "I feel that I am blowing my future because I am just not scoring well on tests these days. I just don't feel motivated to work as hard as I know that I should. \n",
      "\n",
      "So you don't feel motivated and you are not scoring well, have I understood that correctly?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. I know that the two things are probably related but I just do not know what to do about them. \n",
      "\n",
      "What are you currently studying?\n",
      "I am studying microbiology. I do not know that I have the passion for it that I once did though. \n",
      "Your motivation and how you are studying is probably related, you are right. What attracted you to microbiology in the first place?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have always found it fascinating and have an uncle who is a microbiologist. But these days I feel I made the wrong decision. Is it too late to change? \n",
      "It is never too late to change anything. However, i hear that you have always found it fascinating,have you considered talking to your uncle and seeing if you can find what you loved about it again?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes that does sound like good advice. I do not want to turn by back on my studies of the past years. But my grades are really poor and I am not sure what to do about that. \n",
      "Studying can be really difficult , especially when you are half way through. i struggled in my studies and found that talking to my tutors helped and approaching student support. Have you tried anything like that or has your motivation held you back?\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest I have been a little afraid to approach them about the subject because they might accuse me of just slacking. I know it might look like that from the outside. \n",
      "Just from chatting to you, I can sense that you are anxious, however, as many students feel this way, they will have a whole lot of help they can provide.\n",
      "I do feel that part of my problem is that I am afraid to really open up about it. You are the first person I have really felt able to talk to. \n",
      "I am pleased that you have been able to open up to me, it is the first step towards you finding your path. Do you find it easy to write things down?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, it is really much more easy to write my problems down than to actually talk to people about them face to face. \n",
      "One suggestion is for you to write down all the reasons that you love microbiology. It can be any format, I love a bubble chart (mind map), it could be in list form or just doodles, would this be something you would find useful?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that is a fantastic idea! Maybe I can find a renewed interest in the subject. I hope that I can because I really do not want my time studying to have been wasted. \n",
      "It would be a really good place to start. Then you could be really kind to yourself and take some pressure off. Would you like to talk through some ideas to help with the work itself?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I really would. I already feel more motivated! Half an hour ago I felt that I had no place left to go and felt defeated.\n",
      "That's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. Often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. One thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question. Would that be something that would help?\n",
      "I have not really tried it but I ought to. I often feel that I am just overwhelmed. Then I know that I got something wrong for definite and I just want to give up. \n",
      "It could be something you can try, remember , it is not always about ought to, simply how can I make it easier for myself. It is okay to get things wrong too. If you decide to write your list of reasons why you love microbiology, maybe you could keep it in a place you see every day, a mirror or fridge and keep seeing where you are trying to get to. \n",
      "I have already started making a mental list and feel much more optimistic. Thank you very much for your conversation and your help, it has been very valuable to me! \n",
      "You are more than welcome and it has been lovely chatting to you. Is there anything else you would like to talk through?\n",
      "No thank you, you have been most helpful! Have a lovely day! \n",
      "hey! how are you doing?\n",
      "I'm stressed about my college finals.\n",
      "that is a huge stressor! when are finals? what year are you?\n",
      "They are in 1.5 weeks and I'm a sophomore in college\n",
      "that gives you a little bit of time to prepare and you have experience with finals, so that's good\n",
      "yes I'm glad I have time! \n",
      "\n",
      "what specifically is bothering you or is it usualy exam stress plus covid?\n",
      "I think I'm just nervous that I won't get all A's in my classes. I have a 4.0 GPA so I really want to keep that. \n",
      "\n",
      "what a great goal! do you have a plan for preparing for exams? i always found that mapping it out with a study plan helped me \n",
      "Yes I actually just made that yesterday! Check lists help me to get things done so I'm just going to start checking them off one by one.\n",
      "you have a plan and you have some time! what else do you need? chocolate? LOL ;-)\n",
      "haha yes please! that will make me more happy\n",
      "are you on campus? or at home?\n",
      "I actually just left for home yesterday and am here now.  I\n",
      "\n",
      "I will also stay home to do finals instead of going back\n",
      "\n",
      "my freshman has been at home all semester. \n",
      "Oh wow! Thankfully I was able to go back. It helped to be around friends and not at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "fortunately he doesn't know any different\n",
      "yes, it is sad that this semester isn't like last year. That's been hard\n",
      "\n",
      "i can't imagine how wierd it is for you, knowing how it used to be\n",
      "yes, it's a bit depressing to be honest. i feel like i'm not living like a college student anymore\n",
      "\n",
      "i'm sorry it's been so weird for you. but you are killing it with your grades. you shouldbe proud!\n",
      "thank you! its been an adjustment but thankfully im doing good. \n",
      "\n",
      "its got to be good being back home\n",
      "for the most part yes. i do miss my friends obviously\n",
      "\n",
      "i can tell you your parents have been worried about you\n",
      "i think they probably have haha\n",
      "\n",
      "they are glad you are home\n",
      "thank you for your help!\n",
      "\n",
      "keep on crushing it at school, please be safe\n",
      "Hello, can you help me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. I hope so\n",
      "What kind of problem are you having? \n",
      "I am really struggling with my studies at the moment, I am so anxious that I keep putting off my essays and worrying all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like you are a student who is having trouble. Is that correct? \n",
      "Yes, I am a mature student and struggling with my course.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand how you feel. I was a nontraditional student recently who went back to school. \n",
      "It is very understandable that you are feeling stressed, especially with the pandemic and other issues happening. \n",
      "yes, the pandemic is making it worse. I am working as well so I am struggling juggling them all and running a house. I just don't know how to get back on track with my studying\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you thought about putting together a schedule to help you manage your time? \n",
      "How would I go about that?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you go online, there are different templates for students. One would be a time management template where you fill in the blocks of different times of the day. \n",
      "Also, do you know any of your classmates that you could email or text for support? \n",
      "okay, I can see the sense in that. Have you used them before, if so would you recommend putting everything on there or keeping it flexible?\n",
      "\n",
      "I do have a couple that i could contact, I've been feeling really embarrassed to contact them, like they might think I am being silly\n",
      " \n",
      "To start, fill in one week to see what all activities you have to do. Set aside specific time for doing your schoolwork. Try and stick with the schedule. \n",
      "Okay, one week doesn't seem too scary\n",
      "\n",
      "I could colour coordinate it, I like things in colour\n",
      "\n",
      ".I would try it. \n",
      "Ok, do you think I should reach out to my classmates, will they think i'm being silly, I really don't want to alienate them\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe there is a discussion board where you could be anonymous. \n",
      "Break your writing down in small chunks. Just brainstorm one day, for example. \n",
      "I don't think so, however, I might just start with the template and see if that helps first.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like the idea of breaking things into the chunks\n",
      "\n",
      "Try one thing at a time so you are not overwhelmed. \n",
      "Thank you, I feel a little better, maybe I just needed some control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that's good, one thing at once\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree. You are not alone. \n",
      "Thank you, you have been really helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "Hang in there. It is great that you are in school. \n",
      "I enjoyed chatting with you. Take care.\n",
      "I'm pretty stressed out actually\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed\n",
      "Would you like to tell me what's going on?\n",
      "Sure. I just failed a huge test in my college class, and I'm worried it will fail me the entire class, and then I won't be able to get my associates \n",
      "Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety.\n",
      "May I ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?\n",
      "Yeah it's really weighing down on me. It's the only thing I can think about. The test was worth 75%\n",
      "\n",
      "What was you're score?\n",
      "I got a 62% on the test. \n",
      "\n",
      "That isn't TECHNICALLY a failed grade by the standards of most professors. Albeit a low grade, it's a D. Anything below 59% would qualify as failed.  \n",
      "Yeah, but taking into account my scores on homework, I don't think it's enought to pass the class\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you done fairly well in other classes? How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?\n",
      "Honestly it's just kind of all over the place. I am surviving in other classes, but with all this online stuff with the pandemic I barely learn anything. I'm basically faking it til I make it. Which I hate. But I can't learn in these conditions. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that YOU can help. \n",
      "By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise... \n",
      "Yeah that's true, I just think it's not my learning style so it's a lot harder for me. I thought about waiting until things are normal enough to physically be able to go back to class before I try and finish my bachelors, but who knows when that will be\n",
      "\n",
      "OMGoodness no kidding. This whole pandemic has the world in a tizzy! \n",
      "Honestly just talking to someone and letting it out was kinda nice\n",
      "\n",
      "made me feel ebtter\n",
      "\n",
      "If I were you I would not wait! It may not be the best option for your learning style, and it will certainly prove a greater challenge. However, taking on that challenge will bring on SWEETER rewards when you succeed! Adopt a \"Can-Do\" state of mind and grab the bull by the horns!\n",
      "You're so very welcome! \n",
      "Yeah you are right. I shouldn't wait. I don't want to put my life on hold. Thank you so much\n",
      "\n",
      "Online learning is not seems easy, Seems I am going to fail this year\n",
      "chill my dear friend, nothing of that sort will happen\n",
      "In-class learning was way better and I learned a lot but now its so confusing\n",
      "\n",
      "everything you need is a little peace of mind, patience and little more effort\n",
      "Even working with online tools is hard \n",
      "\n",
      "i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties\n",
      "I know but what is I loose a whole year in academic, \n",
      "\n",
      "Think positive my dear friend\n",
      "Shake all your negatives\n",
      "But I have been in low grades continuously during my last semesters. \n",
      "Just have the confidence within yourselves and believe in YOU, that is the most important thing\n",
      "Stop worrying , and think about what can make it better \n",
      "Well it is still hard to understand online learning tools\n",
      "And my internet sometime screws up when I am submitting the assignments \n",
      "I tried that but I am not tech savy\n",
      "\n",
      "Why cant you seek help from a friend of yours who studies well?\n",
      "And who is ready to spend time and help you\n",
      "Due to social distancing I am not meeting with many people\n",
      "But thanks for talking to me it gives me lot of hope\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall try to learn from Youtube more maybe that is the only solution for online learning\n",
      "\n",
      "you dont have to meet a lot of people, but atleast one or two of your friends with all the safety measures ? who could really help you,and also one of the best solution can be group studies as well\n",
      "My pleasure dear friend\n",
      "Hello, how are you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, I'm feeling very anxious about my classes. How are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am doing well, I also get really anxious about my classes. They can be really stressful\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, especially with the pandemic, it's just been so hard to try and focus\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree, there is so much going on that it is hard to stay focused while trying to make sense of all this\n",
      "Exactly. Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to try and do better in my classes? I've tried talking to my professors, but they've all been really unhelpful thus far\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better?\n",
      "\n",
      "Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class\n",
      "\n",
      "I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)\n",
      "I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help?\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.\n",
      "Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off. \n",
      "\n",
      "What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class? Just not enough time or just situations you cannot control. Trust me I understand myself, I have been in college 2.5 years myself. and it took about 1.5 years to get to where I was comfortable with my schedule and personal time\n",
      "\n",
      "I think knowing that I don't have to drive to campus is what makes me feel like I can sleep in. It feels much easier to just wake up and go onto my computer than having to get ready in the morning and drive to campus. I think I mostly miss that routine. Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that.\n",
      "Exactly. It was much easier for me when I had a routine schedule, versus knowing that I can just wake up, roll out of bed, and go to class, but I think that your suggestions are really going to help me finish my semester on a better foot\n",
      "\n",
      "I am really glad I can help, I think part of me was talking to myself as well when giving advice since I have gotten alot lazier these days. I hope you have a great day and hang in there and stay focused and you will do great!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much! I hope you're able to finish off your semester good this year as well!\n",
      "Hello how are you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm okay. Facing a tough decision and having a hard time coping.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that. Would you like to talk about it?\n",
      "Yes, thank you. I decided to go back to school to finish my BA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its great that you decided to go back to school. Are you having trouble selecting a college or something like that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well now with the pandemic I don't know if it's the right time anymore.\n",
      "I understand your concern  given the current pandemic situation. But I have heard some colleges are offering online courses until this pandemic is over. Maybe you can explore in that direction to ease your worries.\n",
      "I'm taking online courses right now, and I really don't like it. I much prefer in classroo\n",
      "m lecture.\n",
      "I definitely resonate with the way you feel about online learning. Although difficult it is also important to stay indoors to keep yourself safe. Is there anything that will motivate you?\n",
      "I don't know. I want to see if I could find classes conducted with Zoom or video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe you can check with the college if they would consider offering classes over zoom as this is the most preferred mode of instruction.\n",
      "I will try to do that. If that's my only option right now, then I will have to settle for classes conducted over livestream. I just don't like self-learning. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds like a plan and am happy to see that you are sure about what you want.\n",
      "Yes, I just wish it could be the way it was. I was so happy to be back in school and I'm so close to being done.\n",
      "\n",
      "I too wish everything goes back to the way it was and it will one day. We have to adjust to a slightly new way of living and this would happen if each one of us do our part to break the chain and flatten the curve. \n",
      "I agree. I still hate it though.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can do it, as you said you are almost there. Once you do it you will be very proud of yourself. Believe me this is just a temporary setback and you are doing a great job.\n",
      "Thank you for the words of encouragement. I do appreciate\n",
      " that.\n",
      "I am glad I could make you feel better. Is there anything else I can do today for you?\n",
      "No. Thanks for chatting with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello How can I help u today?\n",
      "Can you please state your issue?\n",
      "Have there, I have a work issue that I'm hoping you can help me with\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure, How can I help you?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I want to get a qualification but I'm working full-time at the moment and I also work very long hours. the problem is the courses that I want to do a huge time commitment. I'm really angry that I can't seem to get better qualifications to improve my life, because I need to work and need the income to keep me going. I feel stuck and don't know how to get past this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Working and going to school can be tough. It must be very stressful.\n",
      "Maybe you can take less classes or hours at work?\n",
      "Or what are some ways you can relax after a long day?\n",
      "you are right this is very stressful. I've gotten used to the steady income and now we lie on it. the problem is I do work quite late hours so have limited time to study. any suggestions?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would ask for lesser hours if you can or study during your lunch breaks.\n",
      "Perhaps I can ask for a different shift pattern yes, or reduce my hours. I may need to take a look at my finances and do a bit of recalculating. Have you ever had a situation like this?\n",
      "I have not but I know people who are in your situation.\n",
      "I wonder if there are courses and qualifications that you can get just by studying maybe an hour a day or an hour every other day?\n",
      "\n",
      "I would look on sites like Skill share.\n",
      "You can learn a lot on there\n",
      "There maybe some free courses to but I'm not sure\n",
      "ok I've never heard of skillshare, is that a website where you can get more information about work based qualifications etc?\n",
      "\n",
      "Doesn't hurt to check them out.\n",
      "yeah that's very true. I've never heard of that before so thanks for the tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n",
      "also I'm not sure why this is making me feel so angry I think it's the stress of the situation. you mentioned what I can do to relax at the end of the day, do you think this will help see things more clearly?\n",
      "Skill share can help you learn new skills and try out yoga or mediation.\n",
      "yeah I read that yoga I can be really good for your health and your mental well-being.\n",
      "There is an app called Calm that you can use for free or you can pay for it to unlock new features.\n",
      "It can and it keeps you fit\n",
      "I didn't realise there was so much support available. thanks again for the suggestions!\n",
      " \n",
      "You are welcome anything else I can help with?\n",
      "No that's great. Thanks for your help\n",
      "\n",
      "Youre welcome have a nice day/night!\n",
      "Hello there. How are you today?\n",
      "I feel so pressured.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that. Tell me more about what is making you feel pressured.\n",
      "I have to get straight A's to get into graduate school.  I'm worried I will fail.  \n",
      "That sounds like a stressful situation so it is natural to feel anxious. Are there any coping mechanisms you have tried that have helped in the past?\n",
      "I tried studying a lot\n",
      "I know when I am in a stressful it helps to take an occasional break to do some deep breathing exercises and meditation. Have you tried any of these techniques?\n",
      "That sounds like it could help.  Maybe I could even try yoga.\n",
      "Yes, that sounds like a great idea. I think yoga can be very beneficial in managing stress.\n",
      "Do you have any other suggestions for those busy days when I am non-stop?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it is important to remember to take care of yourself. That means eating right and exercising. I found from my own experience of going through a stressful situation that exercise was the best technique for managing stress.\n",
      "Maybe I can get my friends to go for an early morning walk before I start the pressures of the day.  That might work to help me stay calmer.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that there are days where it feels non stop and it can be hard to find the time. Excercising early in the morning is a great idea because it gets you off to a good start to the day. I like the idea of including friends too. That can be a great motivator.\n",
      "Do you have any other suggestions on what could maybe make up for one or two \"B\" grades?  It's hard to be perfect, but these programs are demanding.\n",
      "Indeed it is hard to be perfect and no one is. It sounds as though you are very hard on yourself. From a practical standpoint, you could try talking about your grades with your professors and have a discussion about how to improve your grades. \n",
      "Thank you.  That has helped in the past, so I think perhaps they could give me some guidance as well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "You're welcome. I know this is hard but you have got this.\n",
      "Thanks for the encouragement! You are a good counselor too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. That is kind of you to say. I hope my suggestions help. Is there anything else you want to talk about?\n",
      "I think that is all that I have.  I feel a bunch better.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so glad to hear that. \n",
      "I hope you have a great day\n",
      "Hi, How are you today?\n",
      "I'm driving myself crazy worrying about school.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry to hear that school is so stressful.\n",
      "I can't sleep at night worrying about my upcoming test.\n",
      "That is really hard but I think you can be successful.\n",
      "I just don't know about that.  It's so much pressure to succeed.  The classes are so expensive and I can't fail.\n",
      "It sounds like you are overwhelmed and want to come up with a plan to move forward.\n",
      "Yes, I sure do. Do you have any suggestions?\n",
      "When I was in school, we started study groups.  They were so helpful and encouraging to each other. Are there any study groups available?\n",
      "With COVID-19, everything is so different.  I don't feel like I have study group support.  \n",
      "I see that COVID-19 really changes the way we do things.  Is it possible to do a zoom study group or Facetime with friends?\n",
      "Wow, that sounds like a great idea.  That might work.\n",
      "Do you have other concerns?\n",
      "\n",
      "I do worry still about the financial consequences of possible failure.  If I fail, then I have to retake the class and it is so expensive.  \n",
      "I can see from chatting with you that this is a major stressor for anyone to undertake. \n",
      "Yes, I'm so concerned about having to pass but also how I will pay my bills if I don't pass and don't have a degree. I will have all this college debt and nothing to show for it.\n",
      "I can see where that is a stressor.  I had to repeat a class once and pay for the housing, classes, and financial aspects.  But, I did pass the next time and was able to make a difference in peoples' lives with my career.  Sometimes the stressors and challenges are part of the end goal which is even bigger to humanity.\n",
      "Wow that was very well said. I appreciate that.\n",
      "Keep pressing forward and work toward your dreams because you can do it.  Just the way you contemplate things so much, I can tell that you really care and will make a difference to the world.\n",
      "Thanks for the help. I feel much better.\n",
      "You are very welcome.  \n",
      "I think I'm going to go right now and set up a zoom meet with my friends to study.  You have given some inspiration to me.\n",
      "That sounds like a great plan to start studying with friends.\n",
      "I'm feeling good about this now.\n",
      "Hello, how can i support you tonight?\n",
      "Hi there, I guess I just want to talk about some academic pressure\n",
      "\n",
      "I am just trying to pull an all-nighter and try to get through some lengthy reading of my textbook. I have a final coming up after next week. \n",
      "\n",
      "School can be very demanding. What has you stressed?\n",
      "yeah just trying to speed through the readings as I still have more than a few units to read through \n",
      "\n",
      "All nighters can be rough. Do you have snacks and caffeine?\n",
      "and meanwhile, have one assignment from this course also at the end of this month, \n",
      "and another course's assignment, and that course's exam is coming up next month. \n",
      "yeah just trying to load myself up with coffee. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am used to the idea of staying up because I have been doing that since the pandemic early on this year, but I seem to be distracted and procrastinating, especially in the early hours of the morning, and just go on the computer and waste time, etc. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's kind of hard to sit myself down I guess\n",
      "\n",
      "You can master it within in a month, you are already getting a head start\n",
      "yeah this is my third go through the entire course, the third round of studying. So that the knowledge would be fresh in my mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "just the entire next week is all I have left to get through like 6 units of readings\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes the pandemic has created a lot of challenges for routines and schedules\n",
      "plus finish up the assignment and I have a part-time job, and plus doing some catching with the other course which is all due next month after this course.\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah it sure has. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can go on and on about that too \n",
      "\n",
      "I am confident you can succeed, it sounds like you have a plan and dedication \n",
      "And another thing is by the time I get wise up to not procrastinate, like around 3 or 4 am, I become tired and sleepy, and my brain kicks in and immediately doesn't cooperate. So just a pattern of that going on lately. \n",
      "\n",
      "thanks just gonna do my very best and be mature and catch up because my marks have been good but have been procrastinating, lazy, and slow with everything since the pandemic. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is a tough cycle to break. \n",
      "yeah it's stupid. Once I am done with these two courses, I can finally stop sleeping so late. Because regardless of the courses, I have been sleeping at around the same time, which is late almost every night, since the pandemic started. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think you're saying you will have go put your nose to the grind \n",
      "so it will be a good time for me to take a breather and reset my bad bad habits and circadian rhythm after these two courses. \n",
      "\n",
      "and get back to some normalcy in my life routines. \n",
      "\n",
      "it will literally be a fresh start, next january \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, definitely allow yourself time to breathe\n",

      "yeah too many bad habits from the pandemic and social isolation. Excessive procrastination, not working out much, eating pattern is bad, sleep pattern is bad, etc.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I think you sound very capable, despite the amount of stress you're under\n",
      "its all linked and most of it is due to the pandemic and the studies is just a reinforcement of this loop, fuels it actually.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can get back on track with those healthy behaviors \n",
      "Thank you. I am getting better as each day brings me closer to the first exam. I am actually catching up and I feel guilty of myself for the bad habits and not doing the courses as well as I should but just at the end, I feel like I am getting a grip on it again.\n",
      "\n",

      "probably in the last 3 or so months\n",
      "\n",
      "Did something happen at that time?\n",
      "not exactly. I just have started researching programs and the application process that I will have to start soon and it has been overwhelming\n",

      "What are you contemplating for?\n",
      "I was doing okay in school, but when we had go virtual, I lost all my friends. \n",
      "I want to quit school and just go home. But my parents would not be happy. \n",
      "why do you think so?\n",
      "I don't see anyone but my roommate and she has a boyfriend. I'm so lonely!\n",
      "How about joining a club at school to know more people?\n",
      "We are in a lockdown because of COVID. So the clubs are not doing anything. \n",
      "I know I'm not the only one feeling this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "So you're stuck with your roommate but she doesn't care about you?\n",
      "She's just busy with her boyfriend. They go out on hikes and stuff, but they just want to go by themselves. I'm just on my own all the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone feels that, and it's totally normal. Don't be too harsh on yourself\n",
      "Do you think I should quit school and start again next fall?\n",
      "\n",
      "Why don't you do something on your own? Read a book, do some crafts?\n",
      "I don't think you should do that. Who knows how next year's gonna look like? It might be even worse\n",
      "I have. I've worked on my schoolwork, but it has been very easy. I also paint. But I need people. \n",
      "At home, I had all my friends around. Of course, we weren't in a pandemic then.\n",
      "\n",
      "This pandemic is making everyone feel lonely I think.\n",
      "\n",
      "How about doing video call with your friends at home?\n",
      "I hadn't thought about that!  They are all at different schools, but maybe I can do a Zoom meeting for all of us.\n",
      "\n",
      "I totally feel you, I feel stressed out and very uncertain throughout this pandemic. You are not alone\n",
      "I guess my friends may be feeling stressed too. Maybe I'll try and start a Zoom party!  We could plan a time and wear pajamas and just sit and talk. \n",
      "Exactly, I do virtual happy hour with my friends every month\n",
      "That sounds like fun!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Why don't you do a virtual happy hour every week?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only that, when you feel lonely, text your friends and share it with them or your family\n",
      "Oh I am too busy to do that once a week. All of us are actually\n",
      "I have been afraid to tell my parents how I'm feeling. I don't want them to worry about me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I want them to know I'm lonely, but not freak out about it :-)\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think so. Maybe they are waiting for you to say first and give you advice, they have more experience after all\n",
      "That's true. And I do know my mom is working from home now and she's a really social person. It's probably getting to her too.\n",
      "\n",
      "if that's the case, you can use this chance to be there for her. I think talking to your mom will help you both\n",
      "Yes, I'll probably call her and my dad tonight. I'll let them know I'm a bit sad and lonely, but not so much that they worry. And then I'll start planning my virtual party with my friends!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sounds like a great plan. I believe you can overcome this together\n",
      "At least the party will give me something to look forward to!\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, right now I'm trying to teach myself one day at a time mindset\n",
      "That seems like a smart thing to do. None of us can really do anything to make the pandemic go away. We just have to get through it one day at a time.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for helping me come up with a plan!\n",
      "\n",
      "That's the right mindset. I 'm glad I could be some help\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I am also doing well, thank you for asking! :) What did you come here to talk about?\n",
      "I've just been feeling down about school the last couple of months.\n",
      "\n",
      "I havent been doing as well since covid \n",
      "\n",
      "and I'm kind of upset at my self for it\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh I see. Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah the online schooling is tough for me\n",
      "\n",
      "I cant seem to be motivated and I really miss seeing all my buddies at school\n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't seen anyone in person other than my family since march :( \n",
      "\n",
      "I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from.\n",
      "\n",
      "But you shouldn't feel upset at yourself for how you are feeling. It is completely normal, and I'm sure all your friends are feeling the same way! I have a few things I would like to share with you about how I have been getting through it. Maybe it will help you out :)\n",
      "\n",
      "the virus has been hard on everyone hasnt it \n",
      "\n",
      "sure thing :) share \n",
      "\n",
      "Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed\n",
      "\n",
      "You bring up a good point about changing environment\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like everyday is the same day samething over and over that might be why I'm feeling so down. Plus i work in the basement so I dont get much sunlight\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe I'll try moving to the living room :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I've picked up a couple hobbies and they definitely help keep me busy but with school and all I find I dont have a lot of time for them \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :)\n",
      "\n",
      "You could also plan out your days if it would help! Try and find time for the things that will bring you joy, whether that involves waking up earlier, or moving some routine things around\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah maybe I should do that \n",
      "\n",
      "And I can tell you really do miss your friends, so it's super important to make time to talk to them too!\n",
      "\n",
      "gotta switch things up\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah I should chat with my friends more too \n",
      "\n",
      "Its hard to fine time but I should try\n",
      "\n",
      "It is definitely hard, but it's important for your mental health to keep the people you love close to you :)\n",
      "\n",
      "very very true especially in these difficult times\n",
      "\n",
      "Im hoping they get the vaccine developed asap \n",
      "\n",
      "and everythiung can go back to normal\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes exactly. And yeah that will be so nice when we are finally able to leave again and feel normal. But unfortunately we can't wait around for that since it's so up in the air recently. So I'm glad that you are wanting to change little things in your life to keep you happy until then\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah thank you for your advice ill try implementing them in my life more\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel much better now :) thank you for your time\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course! I had a good time chatting with you! Thank you as well :)\n",
      "Hello! How are you doing today? \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not doing very well unfortunately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I failed my college finals, and now I'm up for Academic Probation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so sorry to hear that, I'd love to understand more about what you are struggling with?\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm almost near gradution too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Academic probation does seem very scary. When did you learn you failed your finals?\n",
      "I learned yesterday. Because of the pandemic the semester is shorter.\n",
      "\n",
      "And how long do you have until graduation?\n",
      "\n",
      "I should be graduating in June.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see. Well it's nice that we matched up! I actually work at a college and now a couple good strategies to get off academic probation, and or avoid it! What is it you are studying?\n",
      "\n",
      "You're a great resource then! I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in Biology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh that is awesome! So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation? \n",
      "\n",
      "Likely in the next week.\n",
      "\n",
      "I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \\\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health\n",
      "\n",
      "I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation \n",
      "\n",
      "That's great advice and likely would be my best option.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will definitely do that. I feel better hearing that it's okay to drop my minor. I felt like a failure when I considered it.\n",
      "\n",
      "From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this. But I want to reassure you that your mental health should always come first. It is the most important thing you can do. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I am very stressed. I hate taking online courses and this pandemic is wearing me out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plus I have a 2 year old son.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are definitely not a failure in the slightest! In fact, I would argue that you are the exact opposite of that. Being able to take such difficult courses in a pandemic, and raise a child shows how strong you are! \n",
      " \n",
      "Thank you for saying that. It is tough, but I just want to finally finish my Bachelor's and do something positive.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you will succeed in that goal. You have the motivation and the care for it, you just need to focus on managing everything at once!\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you thought about meeting with an academic advisor and laying out a plan?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. I had plans to. I am going to go an make an appointment immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate your time, encouragement, and support.\n",
      "Hi, How can I help you?\n",
      "I'm feeling really anxious about my future. I'm not doing as well in college as I want to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else bothering you or it is only the college?\n",
      "Well, I was a great student in high school, but I've found that I'm really struggling with my college classes. I feel rather underprepared and that maybe I don't really belong here. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's good, at least you identified your problem somehow, now is the time to begin solving it\n",
      "What is stopping you to get prepared for the exams?\n",
      "It's just so much harder to concentrate since all my classes are online. \n",
      "Honestly, I feel like my concentration is terrible these days. \n",
      "\n",
      "I had the same experience in the past, I was doing fine in high school but soon after I entered the college I saw myself falling\n",
      "How did you deal with it?\n",
      "soon I realized that It's not high school anymore, It needs more effort and specially more time to comprehend the lessons\n",
      "You can't just pass the exams by studying a day before the exam\n",
      "Ugh, I have a huge problem with procrastination!\n",
      "\n",
      "It used to work in high school, but I guess I really do need to make changes. \n",
      "I know It's hard these days by the pandemic and all online things\n",
      "For some reason, it's a lot harder to ask questions online to my professors. \n",
      "Then you find your answer by yourself, You NEED yo change\n",
      "I guess, but I just feel like I really need someone else to explain things to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have such a hard time concentrating on my own. \n",
      "\n",
      "And remember, your at college, You should start to seek the answers more by yourself and your college mates and be less dependent on professors\n",
      "That's true, I guess I'm still thinking like I'm still in high school and I have a lot of bad habits to break.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I had all your problems but I tried to take the control little by little, the problem is still there but now I can manage it better\n",
      "What was your strategy?\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried different things and I failed many times, You should try too, start to know yourself and how your body and mind works\n",
      "Good afternoon, how can I help you today?  \n",
      "Hi there, I am just stressed about giving a presentation tomorrow\n",
      "\n",
      "That is understandable, public speaking is one of the most commonly cited fears for people.  \n",
      "Is it for work or for school?  \n",
      "This presentation is for school\n",
      "\n",
      "I am indeed worried about public speaking\n",
      "\n",
      "I actually majored in communication and have a great deal of experience with public speaking.  \n",
      "That's interesting, I find public speaking to be especially difficult\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, the physical nervousness that can manifest is powerful.  I would highly recommend finding a quiet place to calm and focus your mind for at least five minutes before your presentation.  At least a minute's worth of breathing, and drink plenty of water.  \n",
      "That very helpful advice, I think another stressful factor is being able to field questions effectively\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, yes, that is a hard one.  You are expected to be an expert.  But you can only prepare so much. \n",
      "Agreed, and there is always that fear that you won't know an answer\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That is a really great question that I've never considered! Maybe XYZ?  I can check on that and get back to you with a sure answer though!\"  \n",
      "There's no shame in being able to say that you understand why someone would ask the question(whatever it may be) but that you don't have a full or even partial answer right now.  \n",
      "Because you're also going to get like, the hecklers and the people who want to look intelligent by asking asinine questions\n",
      "I can understand that, as a I try to prepare for the presentation it's stressing me out about all of the different types of potential questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the advice you gave is very good\n",
      "\n",
      "Just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines.     Extra questions from students are wildcards and you can only handle them within the scope of the assignment.  \n",
      "If someone's like WELL WHY AREN'T THERE PURPLE PANDAS THEN, JEFF?!  you're gonna have to just laugh lol\n",
      "That's fair! I suppose I will have to accept the fact that there is no way to prepare for every eventual question\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you will do great.  You sound prepared, and a small amount of worry is an indication you desire to perform well.  \n",
      "Great thanks, this was very helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so glad to hear that!  You have an excellent attitude and work ethic, you got this!\n",
      "Appreciate your advice, have a good rest of your day\n",
      "\n",
      "Good afternoon! How are you doing today?\n",
      "what if i dont do good on my final\n",
      "\n",
      "this is my first year with student loans\n",
      "\n",
      "i am freaking out\n",
      "\n",
      "I can certainly understand your anxiety you are feeling right now\n",
      "its my masters program. its a hige deal\n",
      "\n",
      "I would be freaking out too. When is your final . How far away is it?\n",
      "i have 2 pages done out of 10\n",
      "\n",
      "Do you have someone you could possibly study with?\n",
      "i work fill time and i am a single mom\n",

      "You have so much on your plate and hard to keep up with everything you are telling me. .LOL. Please may I have a moment to try to help you\n",
      "Could you ask a family member or neighbor or babysitter to help out ? Give you time to concentrate on paper \n",
      "Or how old is your oldest ? Could they watch or help get everyone to bed earlier?\n",
      "my family is 3 states away :/ i guess i could ask my neighbor debbie\n",

      "\n",
      "Hello I am here to talk about some academic stress I am having. In fact, I am just taking a break from my studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "i am doing well, thanks for asking. I hope you're well too. \n",
      "\n",
      "What is causing you to stress over your academics? \n",
      "\n",
      "What is causing you to stress over your academics? \n",
      "\n",
      "Just a little behind and doing some last minute crunch. Two courses. One exam at the end of this month plus one assignment due. The same for the other course but both due end of next month.\n",
      "\n",
      "So just trying to be mature and be hard-working and not get distracted \n",
      "\n",
      "So your trying to work hard at school. Why are you considering taking a break from school?\n",
      "no that's not what I meant. I am just taking a break now to talk to you. But other than that, I sometimes get distracted in a normal day. I am taking two university courses, and both completely online. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oh I see. I am also taking college courses online right now and understand how the end of a semester can be a stressful time for students.\n",
      "yes for sure. I am usually very conscientious, but just due to social isolation from the pandemic, I have been trapped in my house \n",
      "\n",
      "so slacking off and being lazy\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe if you set aside a certain amount of time to devote to your studies (and nothing else) every day, you can eventually start getting back into the normal routine you have for school work\n",
      "and also get and then stay caught up on school work\n",
      "sorry hold on a second. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "be right back in a quick sec\n",

      "\n",
      "I meant to say I agree with your assessment\n",
      "\n",
      "okay. so is there anything else thats bothering you?\n",
      "\n",
      "and that I do set aside time but just that I am at the last stretch and am only preventing further damage as much as I can, even though I am doing fine so far, just not my best self or best capability. Disappointed to say the least.\n",
      "\n",
      "no just have to get through this and I should be okay\n",
      "\n",
      "like I said. I am usually not like this, so I feel that the pandemic so far has made my routines abnormal \n",
      "\n",
      "and life patterns aimless. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope and I feel that you are doing better than I am with your studies\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry you feel that way. I believe that you are strong enough to push through to better times!\n",
      "But yes, I have been trying your tactic somewhat more often this week and next week is my last before the exam and assignment due date. \n",
      "\n",
      "thank you. For sure I will keep persevering. May have to sleep late for awhile but it's what I have to do\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "okay. And thanks for understanding and listening. And sorry again for that interruption just now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate your help and good luck to your studies also. And stay well and safe. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you very much!\n",
      "\n",
      "How can i support you today?\n",
      "I'm just looking for a way to cope with the stresses of my job right now. I work in healthcare and have a lot to do and it feels like I have no time to get everything done\n",
      "\n",
      "I see how that would be overwhelming.\n",
      "It can help to just allow yourself a brief rest when you can.\n",
      "Do you have any good ideas to cope with stress?\n",
      "\n",
      "I find it helpful to find even just five minutes in the morning or evening to meditate.\n",
      "Some deep breathing to clearly our mind.\n",
      "What do you do in the moment when you are overwhelmed? I get so busy I feel like a mess and so unorganized\n",
      "\n",
      "So you feel like everything is happening at once, so how can you get to anything at all?\n",
      "I just feel like my work performance is suffering\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm supposed to get things done in a certain amount of time and I don't have the help I need to get everything done\n",
      "\n",
      "I work for a big company and corporate sets goals that cannot reasonably be met safely in the amount of time we are given with the lack of support\n",
      "\n",
      "This can be a common stressful feeling in health care.\n",
      "Do you have anyone in the organization you would feel comfortable addressing the workload with?\n",
      "I do, but in the past when I have said something I wasn't given a solution, only asked what I think could be done\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we need more staff but they didn't think that was the solution\n",
      "\n",
      "You are within your rights to only do what can be reasonablly expected with quality and safety in mind.\n",
      "It can be difficult, but do your best and do not allow a sense of pressure to impact you.\n",
      "Thank you. I really needed to hear this!\n",
      "\n",
      "I know how unrealistic corporate expectations can feel!\n",
      "Thank you for taking the time to talk with me\n",
      "\n",
      "You are very welcome. Have a lovely evening, thingscwill getvbetter for you!\n",
      "Hello how are you doing today?\n",
      "I am really bummed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I got a bad grade on a paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that\n",
      "I am ok thank you for asking\n",
      "\n",
      "will your bad grade affect your overall grade very bad?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it will affect my final grade a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "oh no, do you think you could do something to earn some extra credit?\n",
      "The professor doesn't give extra credit. :-(\n",
      "I've never gotten a bad grade on a paper before.  Sometimes on tests.  But not on papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was the opposite in school i could pass a test no problem but i was not good on writing papers\n",
      "Is your overall grade pretty high without the grade from this current paper?\n",
      "It was the first grade of the semester.  So only participation otherwise!\n",
      "Maybe you could talk to your teacher and find out what they feel you could have done differently to get a better grade.\n",
      "Yeah...that's not a bad idea.\n",
      "since it is only your first grade of the semester try not to let it get you to down, i am sure you can pull you average back up\n",
      "Overall he said that these grades (to those of us who get them) were like him saying that we might want to reevaluate our career goals!\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you.  That's a nice thing to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "i would not take that to personally. i am sure he was just saying that to make everyone second guess themselves and push themselves to work harder\n",
      "That's a good thought, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh no thanks need you seem to be very smart i am sure you are going to do well\n",
      "Well, you are very nice.  I think it's always good to thank people for being nice!\n",
      "\n",
      "well thank you its always nice to feel apperciated!\n",
      "I wish you all the best of luck with your schooling this semester!\n",
      "Thank you!  ANd happy holidays!\n",
      "\n",
      "Happy Holidays to you to!\n",
      "Hello! What would you like to talk about today?\n",
      "Hi, a little bit of anxiety of academics\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you tell me more about this anxiety?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I am nervous about a test I have coming up because I am wondering if I learned enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am here, it seems that you don't feel like you've studied enough. Is that correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "That and because of the pandemic, I have not been able to connect with the teacher enough to know if I am completing things correctly.  What can I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "It truly depends on the subject! There are online sites that provide free additional instruction\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you tell me what the class is?\n",
      "\n",
      "Its a math class.  I have tried connecting with other students but many are just as confused as me, especially when it comes to showing the work part.  You mentioned online sites, how accurate and helpful are those?\n",
      "\n",
      "Khan Academy is absolutely fantastic! It is extremely helpful and accurate since it is run by educators.\n",
      "Ok, I have to check that out as I have never heard of them.  Did they have any reviews on how helpful they are in the math field?\n",
      "\n",
      "No but I am a former math teacher and I would give them to my students!\n",
      "Okay, that is great.  That eases my anxiety a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am so glad! I know online school is stressful but I think you can do it.\n",
      "Thanks.  I am learning as I go and I am believe I am getting better.  Just got to get use to it.  \n",
      "I can recommend other resources if you'd like.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you, just a couple more if you have them.\n",
      "\n",
      "If this is an upper level math course, you can go to university sites! They always have lessons\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, I will check that out.  Thanks for your help.\n",
      "Of course! Did you have any other questions?\n",
      "No, that was all.  Thank you for your assistance and providing me with some sources that can definitely help.  Have a great day!!\n",
      "Good luck studying! You're capable of doing well!\n",
      "Thanks again for the words of encouragement.  Goodbye!\n",
      "You can terminate the convo at any time!\n",
      "Good afternoon!  What can I help you with today?\n",
      "I've been feeling a lot of pressure and stress lately due to school\n",
      "\n",
      "Oof, yes, school can be a tough situation.   Are you close to the end of the semester?  \n",
      "That can be both a relief and stressful, because a break is near, but all the exams and projects are due.\n",
      "Yes, I am a little more than halfway done with the semester\n",
      "The thing is that I am in a doctoral program, so even though the semester is close to the end, I always need to continue working \n",
      "\n",
      "Ahh, I see.  That is a great deal of time and work.  What are you studying?  \n",
      "It is... I am in psychology\n",
      "\n",
      "I have to work on my thesis on the side even with all of my classes and I have a hard time managing my time and keeping track \n",
      "\n",
      "Time management can be very difficult with a normal class load, that sounds exhausting.  \n",
      "Do calendars help you at all?  I am a super visual person, so calendars and planners are invaluable to me, as well as different colors of ink and labels so I can visually divide my attention\n",
      "Getting a million different colors of pens and highlighters changed my organization for the better.  \n",
      "I do keep a physical and electronic agenda, but I feel like even if I write down my tasks, I find a way to procrastinate which is what I am having trouble with\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, setting clear boundaries for your study/work and relax times may help.  I like to set a timer for, say, 45 minutes, and work/write/read/study for that long, then, I get a 10 minute break.  I'll go outside, refresh my coffee, grab a snack, dance to some music, stretch, then set another timer for 45 minutes, then another break for 10 minutes.  That allows my brain to take a second and refresh from the work.\n",
      "That is actually very helpful, I'll take note of it\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it would help to fix break times so I can actually focus on working \n",
      "\n",
      "Or, like, today, I woke up and spent half an hour allowing myself to drink my coffee and scroll through Reddit.  Then it was time to work on my group project for 45 minutes, then a break, then I worked again, took a break, went to a class, etc.  Scheduling your breaks can be helpful too so your lizard brain doesn't freak out and go \"WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING FOREVERRRR\"\n",
      "I agree!!! That really is helpful, thank you\n",
      "\n",
      "which, for me at least, is where the fatigue sets in.  You're very welcome!  I hope I was helpful.  You seem positive and willing to try new things, and I think you will be successful even if you are tired. \n",
      "The pandemic hasn't really helped either\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm always locked in my apartment and staying sitting down in front of my computer all day\n",
      "\n",
      "Definitely not.  Everyone's Maslow hierarchy getting knocked out from under them is extremely disconcerting.  \n",
      "Hahaha, Maslow, i like it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like how is a person supposed to study, self-actualize, when we literally don't know what will happen next?  \n",
      "I agree! I've also been turning to drugs a lot lately due to the situation. Procrastinating makes me feel guilty, and I end my day too early to smoke and focus my mind on something other than studying....\n",
      "\n",
      "Are there aspects of your study that you dislike, or are you just ready to be done with school?  Little of column A + column b?\n",
      "Hm, I think it has less to do with liking or disliking, and more with starting a very hard and lengthy degree online without any social contact\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah, yes, that makes sense.  And working from home is infamously hard, again, for lack of boundaries, so in addition to just not seeing people and getting the casual affirmation and confirmation messages on a daily basis of like \"hey Jim you did a great job on that spreadsheet\" or \"Haha Jessica you're so funny\", we also are writing papers in our pajamas and bedclothes, which makes it seem interminable.\n",
      "Listening to lectures while the doorbell is ringing and it's just so strange and we aren't set up to do it.  That's why I'm a big fan of specific spaces in my house since March.  I tried to sit in bed with my laptop and do things but 1. I'm old and it hurts my wrists and 2. my headspace is so completely different from being my computer chair and at my desk.  I try to be really strict about where I do my work., maybe trying to structure that a bit could help you feel a little more in control of the work load and your day's schedule.  \n",
      "I agree, that makes a lot of sense! Thank you \n",
      "\n",
      "You have been a big help today and I really feel listened and understood. I really appreciate it\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very glad to hear that!  You sound motivated to succeed and I think that you deserve to take care of yourself and stay healthy to complete your studies.  It will be hard but it will also be worth it, and you should be proud.  Good luck with everything!  \n",
      "Have a great day \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you!  You too!\n",
      "Good evening, what is going on?\n",
      "Hi. I have finals coming up and I am so so nervous about taking these tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about the exams is making you nervous?\n",
      "Taking them. I'm afraid I'm going to do poorly and have to retake the classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "What steps have you taken to make sure you do not do poorly?\n",
      "I study and I have gone to all my classes but I feel like I don't know the information well enough. \n",
      "\n",
      "That is understandable. Sometimes we feel like we do not know enough. Have you tried to have someone quiz you?\n",
      "Yes. I didn't do well on my quizzes. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, since you didn't do well, it seems you can pinpoint what you need to work on. That is a good starting point. \n",
      "Yes, that is a good point. I need to manage my nervousness too because it causes me to make silly mistakes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Depending on how far your exams are, you can create a plan. Practice what you don't know daily, until you do know it. \n",
      "That's really good advice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just trying to make life easier for others. Sometimes we don't see our solutions because of our anxiety. \n",
      "Yes and it's definitely causing me to not think clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its best to take deep breaths and talk to someone who will help guide you. \n",
      "I agree. I just feel bad burdening people with my issues .\n",
      "Don't be. You would be surprised how many people are willing to help. Websites like Reddit are filled with many people wanting to give advice. \n",
      "Okay, I will give Te\n",
      "ddit a whirl.\n",
      "I hope it helps for future endeavors\n",
      "Thank you for taking the time to chat with me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate your advice.v\n",
      "\n",
      "You are welcome :)\n",
      "Hello, how are you today\n",
      "I've been better. I have to give a presentation at work on a stage. This is causing me a lot of stress and problems sleeping\n",
      "\n",
      "What about giving a presentation gave you stress?\n",
      "It is the thought of getting nervous in front of people and forgetting what I want to say.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you taken steps to help you overcome this fear, such as rehearsing in front of the mirror or in front of another person?\n",
      "I have learned my lines and practiced at home a lot. I know what to say almost word for word but I had a bad experience in the past that has scared me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand giving presentations is nervewrecking, but at least you are trying. Are you allowed to take a few notecards just in case?\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for understanding, yeah I suppose I could take notes. I think it is being in front of people and looking foolish that I'm scared of the most. I know a lot of people at work and don;t want them to think I'm bad on stage. Can you related to that?\n",
      "I can definitely relate. It is best to look past the audience and just focus on an object close by. Everyone of us have had to experience this. You are not alone. \n",
      "Hopefully I can try to get past the nerves, some people make it look easy. I'm usually really confident but something about standing on a stage makes me feel very scared and anxious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you go on, try taking a few deep breaths.  Why not try meditating a few days before?\n",
      "I could do I suppose. I won't be the only one presenting that day so I feel like I won't be able to measure up against the other people on stage.\n",
      "Try shifting the focus on what could go wrong, to what could go right? Focus on others congratulating you on a job well done. \n",
      "Yeah I do have a tendency to be negative sometimes and make a big deal out of things. I should actually focus on the good things. Has this technique helped you in the past?\n",
      "Yes, in the term \"fake it until you make it.\" I keep on thinking of what could go right, or in my favor, and when I am done, it actually went okay, and any \"fears\" i had, never came to fruition. \n",
      "I think that is really good advice. I think I have just suffered from a bad experience in the past and this has shaped my way of thinking to always be fearful. I'm fine in meetings or virtually but something about a stage just scares me.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's understandable. But now that you're aware, you have the steps the move forward and be successful. \n",
      "yes I don't want it to hold me back personally or professionally any more\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe you can do it. \n",
      "hey thanks that really helps\n",
      "\n",
      "HOpe you ace your presentation.\n",
      "I hope so too but in future I'll fake it until I believe it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi, what I can help you with today?\n",
      "I had problems in the past and somehow right now\n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of problems were in your past and now?\n",
      "\n",
      "I loved physics and I decided to attend university, but soon after I slowly lost my interest and became unmotivated\n",
      "\n",
      "What was happening in your life that made you lose interest?\n",
      "Actually the professors and the class atmosphere was the reason, and of course the quality of teaching\n",
      "\n",
      "so I started to skipping the classes and failing\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like that is a lot of reasons to be stressed. Have you spoken to a school counselor?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes lots of stress and pressure. I did not, because we didn't have such things or at least I wasn't aware\n",
      "\n",
      "But nobody even pointed that why I'm failing, they just didn't care\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree it is a lot of pressure, but do not let bad teachers deter you. I would reach out to a school counselor and let them know your situation. Every school must have one. \n",
      "Also, physics is a difficult course to study, but if you chose it, that means you have a very strong mind. \n",
      "I loved physics a lot more than now, but what's the point of studying when the teachers are pulsing you not to study! (because of the quality of teaching)\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope there was someone, but I don't think we have a counselor\n",
      "\n",
      "More reason to speak to a school counselor or school administrator. We need to provide help to students, not have bad teachers deter them. \n",
      "Yeah, same with me! I wish I could attend a better univeristy\n",
      "\n",
      "What made you choose this particular university you are at?\n",
      "I didn't have another choice but this\n",
      "\n",

      "yes. tell me what happened?\n",

      "how did you manage stress\n",
      "\n",
      "I tried my best to get more sleep and I studied earlier so that I didn't panic at the last minute. That made it slightly less stressful.\n",

      "\n",
      "are you taking a lot of courses?\n",

      "\n",
      "no it's just that it's a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it's because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow. \n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after.\n",

      "\n",
      "whereas before the pandemic, I can switch gears that way and come back refreshed\n",
      "\n",
      "like going out to the movies and coming back with renewed enthusiasm\n",
      "\n",
      "Yea i have been missing the gym myself. Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day. \n",
      "Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done.\n",
      "I see. Yeah it's good to have a routine and good way to resume life as usual. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "sometimes I listen to music but I find it hard to read and absorb and listen to music. But I do listen to music sometimes when I am on assignments. \n",
      "\n",
      "I also tend to drink coffee to focus my mind better. It does help.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before. So I am missing that sense of \n",
      "urgency, conscientiousness, and maturity. , \n",
      "maybe find a nice meditation song to help relax you, i find when i am doing something finding a song with no words is better so i am able to concentrate. \n",
      "I see. That's a good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was also thinking I should have a regular workout routine at home again because I used to work out much more daily, even at home. \n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like you are a very smart person and are able to acknowledge when you need to work harder on something. Don't be to hard on yourself this pandemic is affecting everyone\n",
      "working out does help me focus and be productive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you and I do agree with you on the pandemic. But this is a part of my mistake too but I think coming away from our conversation, I am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now.\n",
      "I see. Hopefully your routines are much better and more productive now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aww well try not to be to hard on yourself. Set some daily goals and i bet you will be back to feeling normal in no time. I am glad talking has helped!\n",
      "yeah that's another thing. It does work better for me if I were to write down some sort of itinerary of what I should get through today, etc. So you're right. \n",
      "\n",
      "well thank you for listening then and providing some very helpful input. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah you've been more than helpful! Thank you. \n",

      "Hi. How are you feeling tonight?\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that! What seems to be bothering you?\n",
      "I have a real fear of public speaking and I am in a college class that requires me to do this in a large group relatively soon\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand your anxiety.  I hate public speaking too. Is this a required class?\n",
      "Yes i am taking the class this semester and my presentation is due next week\n",
      "\n",
      "have you done any public speaking\n",
      "\n",
      "Only required in high school luckily in college I didn't have to do public speaking . What is your major ? I mean it sounds like this is a part of your major\n",
      "Either way it is EXTREMELY stressful and I would  hate it\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a psychology major and while i am great at interacting with others to help them through thier feelings and any problems or difficulties that may be facing, this one is just different for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can tell this is challenging for you. May I suggest talking with your professor maybe you could pre record your speech and play it instead of actually doing it? Or maybe practicing with some friends or collegues and seeing if they would help you not be so nervous\n",
      "\n",
      "I do not really have any friends I am online student and the presentation is being held on campus at the university and there are no other ways around the public speaking\n",
      "\n",
      "This is certainly a difficult time  and a unique one.  How about searching online for speech public speaking tips and or training type videos or even libraries some have online books/videos\n",
      "I would be willing to do a zoom meeting and practice with you if you would like\n",
      "\n",
      "I have done everything I can think of to prepare for this. I have been meditating to try and overcome this fear. I have spoken about my anxiety to my partner and family as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure there are some support groups out there you could search for maybe. Also prayer works if you believe in God as I do!\n",
      "I am not as anxious on video, just mainly in person in crowds of peopole\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand better now sorry for the confusion\n",
      "Have you spoken to your doctor for maybe temporary mild anxiety pills or something since you seem to have tried numerous things without much help\n",
      "\n",
      "No problem  no need to apologize \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to be on anxity medication but I wanted to get off the medication when I  got sober becuase it could lead to a bigger problem for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I completely agree! I am going be honest and not sure how to help you. I will pray for you but I don't know what else to help \n",
      "i am happy to listen and be your friend \n",
      "WOW! I did not expect something like that to come from someone on here\n",
      "\n",
      "Prayer is the best help in the world. Nothing is more effective than prayer!\n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety is a powerful thing and what may work for one person doesn't on another. I truly wish you the best . I would not want to be in your shoes . I honestly HATE public speaking\n",
      "Yes it is and and most people say nothing left to do but pray and reality is that should be the first thing.  I have learned through many years and dont go to people houses or jam religion down throats but I am led lately to speak up in general conversation if it comes up\n",
      "It does seem to be one of my biggest fears in the world!. I can say that just the topic of prayer and that being of the heavenly father, this topic has helped to ease my anxiety in the present moment and I am sure that God led me here to the platform this evening just for this conversation with you even though it was simple in nature, you have been very helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "People do not talk like this anymore\n",
      "\n",
      "God and anything related has been taken out of conversations\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyways,  it is time for me to go to bed. If we were able I would continue to talk to you and pray but as we can't I wish you all the best . Since you are in college you have your entire life ahead of you I hope.  Covid is temporary and this too shall pass. See you in heaven one day I hope . Goodnight and God bless. \n",
      "Thank you for your time! I will be praying for you as well!\n",
      "I too believe it as well.  and you are right no one talks about it but it should be but it is easier for me with Covid since covid brings up death alot.  you are welcome and Keep safe and God did not give us a fearful mind but ... I don't remember all of it but you could google it .. something sound mind     and Satan will use fear to get us\n",
      "\n",
      "God does not give us the spirit of fear is I beleive what you were referring to and you 100% correct GOD BLESS!\n",
      "\n",
      "tysm we all need prayers. sweet dreams my new friend\n",
      "Good evening :-)  What can I help with you with tonight?  \n",
      "just graduated university and my parents are pressuring me to pursue becoming a doctor\n",
      "\n",
      "Oof, that is a very difficult situation.  I'm sorry you're going through that.  How do you feel about it?  \n",
      "I'm angry. I just want to be done school. but parents are on my butt about it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "What do your parents say when/if you tell them you want to be done with school?  \n",
      "they get mad at me and say they are dissapointed. I want to travel and see the world. not more schooling. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's not a fair thing for them to say to their child.  I will say that there are academic programs that combine travel and credits, but you probably know that already.  And I don't think you should have to compromise anyway. \n",
      "They won't take a compromise. parents are stubborn. What should i do? please parents or pursue my passion?\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot tell you what to do exactly, but I would encourage you to fulfill yourself before anyone else's dictation of your life.  \n",
      "Yeah i'm leaning that. i already graduated university. i fulfilled half of their dream.  you think telling them my honest opinion will be a good idea? \n",
      "\n",
      "I think you need to be prepared for them to not be happy with your honest opinion, but that just because they aren't happy with it doesn't mean it's wrong.  \n",
      "thanks great advise. i will definitely be prepapred. i don't care if i dissapoint them. it's my life not theres. i'll live with the consequences \n",
      "Keep in mind that from their point of view, they want the best for you because they love you, so try not to burn the bridge or salt the earth.  I had a rocky relationship with my dad after college too, but it's better now.  They will survive, and you will thrive.  \n",
      "Thank you. yeah i get that. but they should be happy for me. They cant make decisions for me all the time. let me free!!! \n",
      "\n",
      "That feeling is totally understandable, I felt the same way.  They need to let you find your own way, it's apart of growing up.\n",
      "Thank you. at least someone agrees with me.  Do i have the right to be angry at them?\n",
      "\n",
      "The anger is understandable, but I think it is slightly misplaced as they are not trying to hurt you.  You are frustrated by their lack of understanding and their judgement of your choices, but you and they are both attempting to solve the same problem of your happiness.  \n",
      "Good advice. you are great at this.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's very kind of you to say, thank you :-)\n",
      "Thank you for the great talk. im not as angry anymore. will take there feelings into consideration \n",
      "\n",
      "You are a great listener and have a lot of passion, I think you will be successful for sure.\n",
      "Thanks have a good day. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hi. I have a big exam coming up and I am very afraid of not doing well.\n",
      "Well I can help you study if you'd like?\n",
      "How are you going to help me study? I am not sure if you are familiar with my course material...\n",
      "What is your exam about? Plus you have a whole night to study!\n",
      "My exam is about contract law. I have the whole night, but I have studied all day and am exhausted.\n",
      "I have an idea, do you have any friends in the same course or know anyone that is familiar with that subject? If so, maybe you can communicate with them and they can break it down in a short version.\n",
      "Wow, that's actually a really good idea. I have a friend who took the course last year but I am worried that if I ask her for help she will think poorly of me.\n",
      "Don't worry I know you feel exhausted from studying all day, but she is your friend and friends have each others back especially for school work. You don't have much to lose, go ahead and give it a shot.\n",
      "That is true. I will reach out to her now. \n",
      "I'm sure you will do just fine, you can do it!\n",
      "I still have some self-doubt given that I have failed an exam in the past... \n",
      "Well studies show that if you continuously think negatively, than that is how your life will be lived. But if you try thinking positively and confident than you will more likely live a better life and do better. Try thinking positively the rest of the night and your brain will feel confident enough to remember and retain important information about your exam.\n",
      "I really appreciate this advice. I am feeling better about the exam and feel like I should envision myself passing and doing well. \n",
      "Yes, thats the spirit it works for me!\n",
      "I will give it a try!\n",
      "Okay is there anything else I can help you with or should I let you go?\n",
      "No, I should go study now. thank you for your help.\n",
      "Of course anytime, have a goodnight!\n",
      "Wait! I have another concern.\n",
      "Yes, what is that?\n",
      "Do you have any tips for staying cool under pressure while I am taking my exam?\n",
      "Yes I do actually. First make sure you get a good nights sleep so your brain can rest and function at its best. Next get to class a little early so you have time to soak up the energy in the room and you get a sense of your surroundings. Take it easy and do not rush. Just one question at a time, next thing you know its over.\n",
      "That is great advice. I will certainly try and get a good night of rest.\n",
      "Okay  it has been nice chatting with you, feel free to end the chat now, goodbye.\n",
      "How are you feeling today?\n",
      "It seems like an exhausting time for a lot of people right now\n",
      "I'm also a bit tired but doing OK\n",
      "What's been on your mind recently?\n",
      "just trying to finish this semester\n",
      "\n",
      "It seems like a stressful time to be in college.\n",
      "How have you been coping with everything going on?\n",
      "Nice!  What kind of music do you like?\n",
      "mainly hip hop and r&b but I dabble in some alternative, hyperpop, and edm\n",
      "\n",
      "I also like hip hop and r&b.  It's too bad we aren't able to go to any live music events for a while, though\n",
      "yea. have u done any of the virtual concerts?\n",
      "\n",
      "I've seen them advertised but I haven't tried any of them yet.  I think I saw there was a Lil Nas X one coming up though, might check that out.  Have you done any?\n",
      "yea the travis scott one and the nas one just happened yesterday. think there is only one showing left today then theyre done\n",
      "\n",
      "it was ok nothing amazing\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh good to know.  Yeah, I don't know if virtual concerts can ever really compare to live ones.\n",
      "whos some of\n",
      " your favorite artists?\n",
      "Well, I'm in my 30s so I like the artists who were big about the time I was in high school/college since I have fond memories of that.  So, artists like Nelly, 50 cent, Eminem.  Also I'm from California so I have to say Tupac.\n",
      "I love those guys too. Need to listen to more of their discographys though. My favorites are kendrick lamar and kanye west\n",
      "\n",
      "15 mins past. I guess we're done\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yeah, Kendrick is awesome and makes actual meaningful music.  Kanye also is super talented, sadly he seems to have his issues, but don't we all!\n",
      "It was great talking to you :)  Nice to find someone with shared music tastes.  Hope you have a great rest of ur weekend and good luck with finishing your semester!\n",
      "yea I dont agree with some of kanye's ideology but hes still extremely talented \n",
      "\n",
      "Agree ^   and bye! :D\n",
      "Hiya! =)\n",
      " How are you doing, today?\n",
      "I'm feeling really stressed about university, to be honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm really struggling to find motivation to complete my assignments\n",
      "\n",
      "And it's stressing me out how little work I've completed even though deadlines are coming up.\n",
      "\n",
      "I totally understand that. Which year are you in?\n",
      "I'm in my final year, having to juggle my dissertation with what feels like a million other assignments\n",
      "Oh goodness, I can't imagine how stressful that would be. I've only gotten my associates, and I found that last semester to be a slough. But what kept me going was the relief and joy I would feel once I had that diploma in hand.\n",
      "Are there any study groups or classmates you can get together with, and basically make a night of it?\n",
      "I don't really have any friends on the course, I'm pretty shy and don't really feel comfortable talking to anyone. I kinda promised myself to make more friends in my final year, but obviously circumstances have changed :/\n",
      "\n",
      "Very true, this year made everyone's expectations and plans go out the window lol\n",
      "It might be time to put yourself out of your comfort zone, but start small. Are there any clubs or groups associated with your major? That way, you have some common ground to work with.\n",
      "I'm honestly not sure, I guess I've always been too nervous to reach out to anyone. I'll have to have a look.\n",
      "\n",
      "That sounds like a good idea =) Even if you can't hold club meetings on campus or have any gatherings, maybe they hold their meetings over video calls. One plus side to that, is that you don't need to have your camera on to participate.\n",
      "That's true. I also feel a bit nervous about my final grades, I've done well so far but just feel like this year might mess everything up.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's understandable, especially with how the past year has been. Everyone is on edge and everything feels so uncertain, but that's okay, because you're not alone =)\n",
      "You said you're doing well so far? Take pride in that, and focus on that. \"If I've been doing well so far, I must be doing something right. I'll just keep doing what I have been, and everything should work out in the end.\"\n",
      "Yeah, I am really proud of what I've done so far but it just makes me worry that I won't meet my own expectations\n",
      "\n",
      "We can be our own worst critics, and that's never been truer than when we're facing a challenge. Self-doubt can be such a pain, but when I find I'm having trouble believing in myself and working toward my goals, I'll focus on what I already accomplished, and that helps give me that extra push to keep going\n",
      "I might be an internet stranger, but I'm proud of you, too. =) You've got one and a half semesters to go! You've got this! I believe in you! <3\n",
      "Thank you, it's actually made me feel a lot better! :)\n",

      "You're very welcome, I'm glad I could help =)\n",
      "Hi there. How are you doing today?\n",
      "I'm doing alright, and yourself? \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm doing pretty well. Do you have anything going on today?\n",
      "Yeah I ended up going biking earlier and now I am doing school work. How about you? Do you have anything going on today? \n",
      "Oh biking is an excellent activity to do with everything going on. How are you feeling with it all? What are you studying in school? I'm just getting household chores done, nothing too exciting.\n",
      "I'm feeling alright. The current pandemic situation in my city has made it restricted to be with people other than immediate family so that's been tough. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm currently studying finance and I'm loving it. I'm in my last year so I can't wait to finish that up \n",
      "\n",
      "I understand that it is really difficult to be kept on lockdown. \n",
      "Are you biking regularly to help with the feeling of being stuck inside?\n",
      "Yes. It's great that my city has a program where we can get a bike pass for $99/year. There are bike stations set up all over my city so that has helped with my sense of being cooped up.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's really helpful in these times to find something to keep yourself productive and mindful that things are going to get better\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree, It's really great that you are finding ways to get out of the house. \n",
      "Have you tried video chatting with the people you can't be around right now? That has really helped me not feel so alone right now.\n",
      "I have and that has helped for me as well. I also have a dog so that has helped me have the feeling of being around \"someone\" even though they're not human. \n",
      "\n",
      "I haven't video chatted anyone in quite some time though, I probably will do that later on today!\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, I think it's great that you are finding things like biking, playing with your dog, and video chatting to help get you through these times.\n",
      "Lately, I've been focusing on self care a lot more to help with de stressing with everything going on. Have you tried this?\n",
      "I haven't tried that, I'll have to try something similar. I haven't been focusing on self care at all recently\n",
      "\n",
      "Self care is so important even when there isn't a pandemic. It can help you connect with yourself and make you feel less overwhelmed and just give you YOU time. Some of my favorite ways to do this is listening to podcasts, meditating and focusing on my breathing, listening to music, and pamper myself with face masks etc.\n",
      "I suggest you practice self care starting once a week and work it up from there giving yourself at least an hour a day if you can\n",
      "Do you have any recommendations for medicating? I've been looking to get into it as I know it has helped many people. But I haven't found any easy way to divulge into the topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "I appreciate you recommending that I spend an hour a day. I think something like this could better myself into living a much happier and fulfilled life.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest listening to Jay shetty he is on most podcasts apps. personally, I use stitcher. If you can download a podcast app you can just type in \"Meditation\" and it will pull up several options to try out. Another great app is called MyLife Meditation by stop. breath. think. That's a great started meditation to try.\n",
      "I think I'm going to try to start with your podcast that you recommended. I already listen to podcasts daily so that wouldn't be hard to fit into my routine! :) \n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like this could be something that would fit right in with your life and even help improve it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do! There is so many great books out there and other podcasts as well about self care. \n",
      "Thank you so much for all your help today and guiding me in the right direction. I truly am thankful for speaking with you today :)\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so glad I was able to help. Enjoy the rest of your day and remember to set aside sometime for yourself. It was great chatting with you.\n",
      "Likewise! Take care! :) \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, I would like to talk to you about my academic pressures\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you may be able to help\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes here to listen and to help you in anyway I can\n",
      "I guess the problem is that I am faced with impending deadlines with my studies, and that I am not that great with my organization or time management, and compounded with distractions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I don't know if you have any tips or personal experiences on how to deal with such issues\n",
      "\n",
      "By any chance have you thought about trying out some time management class?\n",
      "No, because time management I feel is something that I have to resolve on my own, and I have enough courses on my plate right now. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I guess for time management, I tend to be distracted easily or spend too long on other stuff outside of my studies\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh ok I see. I have actually been in this type of situation before, and I took those classes and they actually helped.\n",
      "I see. So would you be able to share some tips on time management? \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes sure I can .\n",
      "like specifically, I don't know. I am just going with my instincts and my instincts aren't great or mature \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Find out where your wasting you time? Try creating time management goals? Implement a Time management Plan\n",
      "well I guess I can put out like a time table on what I should get through in the day, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "setting alarm clocks on set times, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes thats a great idea.\n",
      "You could also reward yourself when you have done a good job\n",
      "But also, with the ongoing pandemic, it doesn't help either. For example, I am trapped at home and it feels claustrophobic but it's not safe to go out either. And my mind wanders in such circumstances too.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes that's good advice. I have done it but sometimes I overdo my rewards like take too long of a break, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "so in my opinion, I need moderation and maturity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can relate to that as well. This pandemic has gotten everyone down.\n",
      "for sure. It's really really distracting and has made my life and mind wander aimlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was a lot more productive with my life and studies before March or so\n",
      "\n",
      "Dont be so down on yourself you are mature. Just need a little help managing some things.\n",
      "Yeah true. On that point, I know I have done well before, and I know I can pass, but I don't like the direction I am going in and these new trends. \n",
      "\n",
      "so I feel disappointed and guilty because I know I am better than this and ought to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you do some of those suggestions I believe you will be just fine.\n",
      "yes for sure, your advice will be fresh in my mind after our chat. I have a renewed need to attend to my studies so I do feel that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh also do you like music?\n",
      "just have to be more hardworking and contentious, basically.\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "I try not to put music on while I study but I do that sometimes when I am doing other forms of assignments. So I have my rules on those. \n",
      "\n",
      "While your studying play some soft music in the background that you like and see if that helps.\n",
      "yeah I will, from time to time.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I am good to go from this point. Thank you so much for your helpful input.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your so welcome and Thank you for allowing me yo help\n",
      "I'm so stressed, my emotions and anxiety is through the roof\n",
      "What do you think is the cause of that?\n",
      "I have a my masters thesis tomorrow and we have to do a presentation. A public speaking presentaion\n",
      "Oh, so it's the public speaking that has you rattled?\n",
      "Yes, I have a specific professor that intimidates me and knows that she can rattle me. I wish I could avoid her. \n",
      "That sounds like it'd be enough to upset anybody.\n",
      "I know, right! I know I have my material ready to present and feel confident, its just how she gives constructive criticism and that her decisions and 25% of my final grade\n",
      "I think most people aren't big fans of public speaking.  \n",
      "The last class I had with her she was very aggressive when I asked questions aloud. Almost if she was put out.  Also told me that my bumper sticker that says \"stop heroin\" was ignorant. \n",
      "Well she sounds like kind of a pain in the ass honestly, I had a teacher like that one time myself.\n",
      "I have so much anxiety and emotional conflicts going into the last assignment. Just wish I had some good coping mechanisms to practice to get me through this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh yes!  a PITA!\n",
      "That made me giggle a bit. Thank you for that\n",
      "Maybe you could try and just put things in perspective.  I mean this will all be behind you soon enough, and no matter how it goes it's not like you're going to wind up on skid row over it, I wouldn't think.\n",
      "You are right, only skid row I know is 18 and life. Best with Sebastian Bach \n",
      "So in the short term I'd just try to get a good night's sleep, give it your best shot, and keep in mind that it's not really all that significant in the grand scheme of things.\n",
      "Now that helps take me back to a better time. It will be over before I know it. Thank you for the nice uplifting words\n",
      "Well my pleasure, I hope that was of some help!\n",
      "Thank you so much, I feel much better \n",
      "Well good!  So now what do we do?  Does this count as finishing the hit?\n",
      "I tried to finish and quit, It states I have more time. you?\n",
      "Hang on, let me look and see\n",
      "now we are good, try it now\n",
      "Hi there - how can I help you this evening?\n",
      "\n",
      "i'm just feeling nervous about scheduling classes for next semester at university\n",
      "\n",
      "i want to take classes that will give me skills rather than theory\n",
      "\n",
      "because i'm worried about finding a job after i graduate, because of the economy during the pandemic\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand that, there are probably a ton of classes to select from.\n",
      "\n",
      "What kind of skills to you want to gain?\n",
      "for me, i want to have strong writing skills and also some hard skills, like excel and programming\n",
      "\n",
      "That's great, the computer skills will help out a lot.  And the programs help with writing skills too.\n",
      "Do you have anyone like a counselor you can consult with to help you make a decision? When I was in school, I developed a relationship with the counselor so I felt comfortable asking.\n",
      "i do have an academic advisor, but i don't think he understands what i'm looking for\n",
      "\n",
      "i might ask one of my other professors to see what they think\n",
      "\n",
      "No? That's too bad.  It helps to have like a mentor and maybe that professor would be a good source.  Sounds like a good plan.\n",
      "yeah hopefully that will help\n",
      "\n",
      "i need to decide soon\n",
      "\n",
      "You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders and want to be able to get a good job when you graduate.  I think it is wise to seek advice now.\n",
      "Do you think you have a strategy?  Talk to your professor and see if he can help or maybe he can provide another solution?\n",
      "yes, that sounds like what i should do\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish you all the best - I am confident you will do great!\n",
      "thank you for your help!\n",
      "\n",
      "You are certainly welcome.  I'm glad I could help.\n",
      "Have a good rest of your evening.\n",
      "Hello, how are you doing?\n",
      "I have been better. I am really stressed and feel like I am at a breaking point. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to hear you are near your breaking point, do you have any idea when the decline and stress began?\n",
      "It began a few weeks ago. I have had a really intense project that is on a time crunch. I feel like I am overwhelmed and unable to balance work and personal life. \n",
      "Work and personal life are very hard to juggle with each other, especially in the current life situations around the globe.  I am sure you will successfully handle both in the overall. \n",
      "What should I do to help feel like I can manage and push through? Right no w i feel like giving up. \n",
      "For me, when I start getting overwhelmed and need to \"debrief\" my mind, and \"declutter\" the stresses, I use a notepad. I jot down every detail I can that pops into mind. Every upcoming task, everything that has caused anxiety or similar, and then I prioritize them in an agenda. It seems tedious, however once you get a handle on scheduling, in my personal ex\n",
      "perience, it is easier to hold yourself accountable and slowly work your way through accomplishments, even small tasks, which is encouraging to continue. \n",
      "Sometimes, something as small as an \n",
      "accomplished task can uplift a mood greatly. Especially when listed and checked off to see the progress. \n",
      "Thank you. That seems helpful. I tend to make excuses for myself when I feel like this and allow myself to slip in other areas of my life. For example if I am stressed, I tend to eat unhealthy food. Overall its hard to juggle all things I want to do and be at once. I will plan to make a list and check off some small things. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you visually see your success, I hope it will help like it does for myself. I personally believe that it is a useful tool, depression runs deep and anxiety pushes it over the edge with deadlines. Life and Personal are very complicated situations. As is living, in itself. Small accomplishments, maybe with minor rewards to\n",
      " yourself as you go, boosts confidence and tends to fade out the overwhelming heavy feelings. \n",
      "What do you consider to be a minor reward that would be a good tool for me today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have created a list and was able to check one thing off already. This has helped some and I feel a little more relieved. \n",
      "\n",
      "A punch card. If you have one handy, a note card/index card. Draw maybe, 15 circles around the edge, and call it \"My rewards\" In the middle, choose one thing you enjoy, for instance, if you like an ice cream sundae, put that in the middle. For your first task, just jot all that is on your mind down, and also use that as the first task to yourself. Check off one circle, and once you hit 15 get that sundae! \n",
      "\n",
      "Awesome! I am happy to hear that it has already helped a little! \n",
      "Thats a great idea. I really like that!\n",
      "\n",
      "I do sincerely hope you start feeling better, the current average life has altered greatly, and it has changed workloads and balances with great challenges. \n",
      "Yes. We are all being challenged and perhaps this will help people grow. I know that once i an over the hump I will be happy i did it and put in the effort. I appreciate the in the moment help! \n",
      "Absolutely, I appreciate the chance to speak with you and give suggestions. \n",
      "Do you have nay other tips that i may use?\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps, nature. A walk alone somewhere pretty tends to be a refreshing, zen-like activity. Or even, as a meditation type approach, rock stacking. It takes much focus, and tends to leave your mind clearer in the end. I also recommend reading, or listening to audio books of a theme you are interested in. It brings comfort in activities\n",
      "thank you. It is sometimes hard to make time to do those things. I think i will try and scheduled them into my dat\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello how are you doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m doing OK. I’m just a little anxious and nervous about my upcoming exams. \n",
      "I am sure you are trying the hardest you can\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I am. But these virtual classes are very difficult. \n",
      "Have you tried looking for guidance from your peers?\n",
      "It is much easier to lean on other students when we are in a class. But with virtual, it is much more difficult. \n",
      "I understand how you are feeling. It is nice to have somebody to lean on during difficult times.\n",
      "I just have to focus on my studies and not let what is going on impact my studies. \n",
      "I believe in you and i think you will do great!\n",
      "Do you have any advice on keeping me focused?\n",
      "What is your exam on?\n",
      "Economics and Business Law. \n",
      "You should find a nice quiet spot to study. Maybe find something to feel you calm which will help you stay focused.\n",
      "Good advice. I usually study in my bedroom, but that leads to distractions, such as TV and others wanting to talk. \n",
      "Also make sure you are comfortable and have good lighting. That should help to.\n",
      "Yes. I just have to buckle down and focus. Any advice for my anxiety?\n",
      "Do you have any music you like listen to? I always find music to be calming.\n",
      "Yes. Good point. Might try some yoga too. \n",
      "I hope i was able to help you and wish you best of luck.\n",
      "Thanks.  You definitely gave me some good advice. I appreciate it. \n",
      "Hello, I have been feeling very overwhelmed with school.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello. I totally understand being stressed out by school. I am currently in a Ph.D. program and it can be overwhelming. Do you have any hobbies to help with your stress?\n",
      "I do like to read, but I haven't had enough time. I have been going on walks more frequently.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like you do a lot of activities that are solitary. Have you considered maybe partaking in a similar activity, like a book club, where there is more interaction with people?\n",
      "No, I did not consider that actually. I do enjoy my alone time since I am so busy and I have a toddler, but maybe doing something more sociable would be good.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being busy, especially with having a small child can make you feel lonely, enhancing the stress you feel from school. Participating in social events geared toward your interest might be able to connect you to people with similar feelings!\n",
      "I think so too. I never thought of it like that.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sure that you are trying your best to be both a good student and a great parent. It is understandable that you may not have considered those options.\n",
      "Yes I constantly think of my son and family, and I didn't think involving myself in sociable activities\n",
      " would be beneficial.\n",
      "I figured I really needed some alone time. I didn't realize I could be experiencing loneliness.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is so admirable that you are acting so selfless.\n",
      "Are you aware of any activities that you can participate in that can include your family? It could be the best of both worlds.\n",
      "Yes, we like to go swimming at the YMCA together.\n",
      "That is great! Physical activity has been shown to reduce stress levels.\n",
      "My sister-in-law really benefits from having her sons in sports. She is able to connect with the other team moms and considers them some of her best friends. Depending on your YMCA your son may be able to participate in some of their programs?\n",
      "Yes, and swimming is great exercise.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if we do that more we can spend more time together.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been looking into putting him in soccer.\n",
      "\n",
      "He can start at 3 years old.\n",
      "\n",
      "Soccer would be a perfect way for both you and your son to interact with other people of similar interests.\n",
      "I think so too. You gave me a lot to think about today that I didn't consider before.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad to help, Hopefully, considering these options will not only reduce your stress from being busy with being a parent and with school, but it will also bring you closer to your child.\n",
      "Yes, and both of those are major goals of mine. But the stress sometimes feels inevitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes stress is inevitable. You just have to know how to channel it. Some use physical activity, others use journaling. These seem to be outlets you can consider?\n",
      "The physical activity for sure.\n",
      "I do so much writing with my Master's program. Sometimes I feel like my hand will fall off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical activity seems to be the option you are most interested in.\n",
      "Have you considered setting daily exercise goals?\n",
      "Yes, I am a pretty active and fit person.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I do try to go to the gym 3 times per week at least.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having goals for a given day can help motivate you to do the exercises and keep your head cleared from stress.\n",
      "I agree. I will definitely start to engage in more activities with peers and more swimming with my family. Thank you for your advice!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello there, how are we doing today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi ineed help, parents are putting to much pressure on me \n",
      "\n",
      "Im sorry to hear that your parents are putting to much pressure on you, do you want to go into further detail?\n",
      "Yes. For some reason my parents put so much pressure on me to do well in school its killing me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure they just want what is best, but i have been there as a teen as well. What matters the most is how you feel. Have you talked to them?\n",
      "No. i haven't im scared they will be so mad at me telling them how i feel\n",
      "\n",
      "Have you tried talking to a school counselor?\n",
      "No, i haven't but i will take your advice and talk to a counselor\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a good first step. Also depending how old you are some therapists work on a sliding scale or wave fees if you cant afford it.\n",
      "The counselor may be able to act as a mediator between you and your parents.\n",
      "That's great. it will definitely ease some tensions\n",
      "\n",
      "I wouldnt hold off to long as these types of problems tend to brew and just get stronger. I know you will feel better once you let it out there. I hope it is even helping now.\n",
      "I will talk to the counsellor first and see what they say. \n",
      "i feel so much better now\n",
      "\n",
      "I am very happy for you\n",
      "thank you. feel less pressure\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else on your mind that i can help you with?\n",
      "no that's it. you've been very helpful \n",
      "\n",
      "Great, make sure you do it, it might be rough at first but stick with it and im sure youll do great.\n",
      "Yes sorry, the communication program was lagging a bit. \n",
      "Thank you. i will do my best to get it off my chest \n",
      "\n",
      "it is.  But thank you for our advice \n",
      "\n",
      "You are very welcome!\n",
      "Hello, how are you feeling?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, I am fine at the moment, but I just have a general sense of nervousness as I am not looking forward to facing up to academic deadlines. \n",
      "\n",
      "And I have a few assignments and two exams coming up (all to be done at the end of this and the next month)\n",
      "\n",
      "You're feeling nervous because you have a lot to do this month academics-wise and you're worried you won't be able to succeed. Am I correct?\n",
      "\n",
      "Right, plus I am nervous because I am scared that I won't do as well as I would like under the constrained time and sporadic slacking off. Just that fear as impending deadlines come up. \n",
      "\n",
      "so I guess I need to feel hope and optimistic and renewed sense of wanting to work hard and do well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I know exactly how you're feeling. I felt the same way until I made myself follow a strict studying regimen which helped a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see. I am kind of doing that but I do get sidetracked from time to time. I get distracted by my computer and the TV, etc. It's on and off like that. I agree with you that I find that the method of following a schedule and regimen is useful to me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think it's great you're taking steps to try to help yourself. With a little more focus, I think you'll be able to succeed!\n",
      "\n",
      "And plus I find that when I drink coffee and become influenced by caffeine, I become euphoric and more focused for some reason, so that's one method I have used. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for your trust in me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, apparently caffeine helps increase focus, as long as you don't overdo it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I guess also on top of the fear, I also feel a sense of disappointment because I am and have been a conscientious person, someone mature and responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like what also helps you? And can you elaborate on your strict regimen?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I can feel your disappointment in yourself just by speaking with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks for sympathizing and understanding. \n",
      "\n",
      "of course! I find doing an hour of work at a time without looking at my phone is very valuable. \n",
      "\n",
      "You can set a timer on your computer and put your phone in another room or on the other side of the room to minimize temptation.\n",
      "\n",
      "ok. That's true and I have to do more of that. Phone is also a big distraction for me. I heard that it's best to get it out of one's reach for best results. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I struggl\n",
      "ed with focus but once I put my phone away, my focus increased a lot.\n",
      "I think that's pretty good advice. I know which room I can do this, but just away from temptation plus having an alarm from the other room to go off after an hour or so of reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "ok, I will employ these methods more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you for sharing these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course! Is anything else on your mind?\n",
      "\n",
      "then hopefully after these two courses are done, I can have renewed faith and maturity after the new year and take new courses with better results. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "not much, just academic pressure and how to deal with time management and being contentious. \n",
      " \n",
      "yes, that sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you're really trying to help yourself grow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes I hope so, because when I was younger, I used to be great at not being distracted so much in my studies and just bang it out real quick and well with my books\n",
      "\n",
      "and all this is also worsened by the pandemic, I am afraid, of just not having a renewed from the indoor isolation. \n",
      "\n",
      "yes, it's true people begin to struggle with focus as they reach young adulthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand how you're feeling, COVID has affected me negatively as well but I'm just trying to look at the bright side.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes it has on us all. I guess the other thing is that my city has been doing fine so far, but just the past two weeks or so has been more and more cases, so just getting stressed and depressed with that and prospects of a second shut down. \n",
      "\n",
      "so yes, the second wave is here it seems (belatedly), but hopefully it doesn't get worse, because I have seen worse in other places right now\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I would suggest taking up yoga or meditation to lessen the stress COVID has on your brain.\n",
      "\n",
      "so I suppose just trying to cope with that also because I get nervous having to go out for work or errands, and I also have to write my exam outside of my home. \n",
      "\n",
      "ok. I could look into that. I work out in general, but have been slacking off on those ever since the pandemic started this year. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, I'd recommend wearing a mask whenever you go out to lessen the chance of you contracting anything. At the moment, it's all we could do.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes and I have been and will continue to do that. \n",
      "\n",
      "But aside from these stressors, I think I have a better idea now on how I should proceed, starting today \n",
      "\n",
      "that's amazing, I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease.\n",
      "not that I haven't, but just with more renewed faith and having fresh priorities in my head. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "yes thank you very much for listening and understanding with my issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, sometimes we all just need to talk to someone.\n",
      "your input has been helpful and it does help for me to kind of vent out on what has been bothering me\n",
      "\n",
      "yes so true. Thank you for that. \n",
      "\n",
      "alright then. I will continue my day from here then. Thanks again, and good luck with your endeavours!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright, please reach out if you need to talk again! Thank you so much!\n",
      "I'm so worried about my child who has so much homework and despite studying all night still is struggling.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! How are you feeling today?\n",
      "I'm a bit worried today and nervous.\n",
      "You are a very good parent to care and worry. I get it, I am a mom myself! Is your child doing digital learning or in person?\n",
      "It's actual a hybrid which is challenging.  2 days in school and 3 days at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can see how that is challenging\n",
      "Is it the same teacher for both? \n",
      "She has about 9 teachers and it's only 6th grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "That has to be really frusterating not having just one teacher you can go to in order to see if there is anyway to help your child not struggle\n",
      "I want to push her to keep working, but also want to give her a break from all the work.  There is so much homework for a little child.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps you can find out which classes your child struggles with and contact the teacher(s) or school to set up a conference? I know some schools even have peer tutors they say help pair students with! \n",
      "I'm thinking about tutoring possibly but being home and going to school it is so overwhelming already and to add tutoring to the list is another question for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "My children are five and eight. My eight year old spent about ten hours doing digital learning the other day when in-perosn was closed. I was so frusterated. I let her pick a movie and snack when she was done to reward her for finishing. \n",
      "Yes, we've had some months worth of snacks!  Good thing for Burger King!  \n",
      "\n",
      "Have you looked into any edulational or learning games?\n",
      "There is nothing wrong with rewarding your child for doing good in school or getting thier work done! :) \n",
      "That is a good idea.  I wonder if they have one for vocabulary as that is the test tomorrow!  She says she loves them.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'll have to look!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have done that with my kids. Technology is such a huge part of children's lives these days, they will play a videogame in a heart beat. I don't think they even realize they are learning sometimes!\n",
      "I have to do some research though and doing this x 3 kids is draining on top of work\n",
      "\n",
      "check out the website adventure academy. They have things for all ages/grades! \n",
      "Thanks so much for all your help!  I'm feeling somewhat better and encouraged!\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a good day!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm glad I could help! You too! \n",
      "Actually I have one more question\n",
      "\n",
      "okay, what is it? \n",
      "Do you think I should feel guilty for making her study?\n",
      "I think it is natural for a a parent to feel guilty when they are having thier child do something the child doesn't want to do. i think the benefits outweigh the negatives though. i think finding a way to make studying fun could be a win-win. you are a good parent for wanting the best for your child!\n",
      "Great advice.  Thanks again.  Take care!\n",
      "I think there should be more parents out there that care about their children and their children's future like you do. keep up the good work! \n",
      "Hello, how can I help you today?\n",
      "Hello, I am taking two courses online now that are nearing their end, one at the end of november, and one at the end of December. I guess I am just scared and stressed out about not doing well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have been in that same situation before! I had the exact feelings you are! But after realizing how much I studied it helped me relax.\n",
      "Have you talked to your teachers about your worrying?\n",
      "I see. My problem right now is that due to the pandemic and having a lot of time to myself and getting restless, I tend to waste a lot of time doing other things, and procrastinating. So I am catching up and I know I can finish them, but just that I could have done better, so there's an element of guilt and shame involved because I am not happy with my actions on how I handled my studies. \n",
      "\n",
      "No, not yet. It's distance education so it's mostly me studying on my own time (each course runs at a max duration of six months), but I have reached out to them regarding some assignment and exam questions. \n",
      "\n",
      "But I do appreciating your sympathetic tone and that you've gone through this also. \n",
      "\n",
      "And also I go through things slower and things become more sluggish and not really motivated, whereas before I was faster and more productive and really interested in learning and trying to finish assignments etc as quick as I can, and not take the full 6 months of course deadline. \n",
      "\n",
      "From what I have seen, people who have noticed they are having issues tend to come out ahead! Its great that you are thinking about how to get through this.\n",
      "I also get into slumps with being productive and motivation, I was told when that happens that I just need to take a step back and relax for a little bit.\n",
      "I see. I do see a problem and just last week I kind of started to prioritize things and take things more seriously, as the deadlines wind down. I am a little behind schedule, but not severely. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "yes I do that too. I understand what you mean. The problem with me is I alternate with relaxation with studying too much, and blurring those lines too much. \n",
      "\n",
      "But yes, I have been going back on track since last week and hope it's not too late to catch up\n",
      "\n",
      "That's really great! I bet you are closer than you think to finishing those deadlines.\n",
      "the stress and panic of the last minute crunch has worked in the past for me in becoming more conscientious\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you. I appreciate your input so far. \n",
      "\n",
      "When you are usually in a last minute crunch, what do you do to get past it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I really really try to focus and just put all distractions away. Drink coffee, sleep less, and just get it done with less distractions with only the outcome and goal on my mind. It usually works and I did that for example, yesterday. So most of my day at home yesterday was spent on studying, and not so much on other preoccupations.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know some people look for tutors, or others taking the same classes for inputs on work that has to be turned in.\n",
      "Is there an easy way for you to put the other preoccupations to the side so they are not so distracting?\n",
      "yes I understand that too. I tend to be more solitary in nature. For me, I talk to my friend for help, a really close friend for advice and my troubles. But most of the time, I get through these logistical and existential problems myself. Not so much that I don't know how to do them or understand the courses or how to do the assignments, but just help on time management and organiza\n",
      "tion. \n",
      "\n",
      "yes I can do that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Thats good! I bet that would help out a lot, that tends to be the case for me!\n",
      "It's harder now though because I am just trapped at home, and plus a lot of my course materials are on the internet and on my laptop (distance education), and so I need to kind of focus on not clicking other stuff (including this website, etc). \n",
      "\n",
      "yeah that's good to hear but I think you asking these questions does make me focus more on what questions I need to ask myself\n",
      "\n",
      "like can I put this stuff away, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thats good, research has shown that moving our distractions to the side allows us to focus more on the task at hand!\n",
      "Also, with being at home all the time, time is warped for me, such that time passes really fast even though it's been many hours. And I then realize the time wasted, etc, just some observations. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think our conversation so far has been fruitful in that I have a better idea on what my priorities ought to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, me chatting with you right now is just because I am on a self-imposed break, and not a diversion. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad to hear that! I bet you can get those deadlines finished no problem.\n",
      "sure. I will do that and I hope you're right. \n",
      "\n",
      "like passing, I could, but at the same time I don't want to just pass the courses barely. I am not a terrible student, but just disappointed because I ought to know and do better. \n",
      "\n",
      "But yes, I think I am ready to take on the challenge and burden again and thanks a lot\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad I was able to help, You got this, I bet you don't have this issue again.\n",
      "for reassuring and pointing out certain things for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "thank you. I really appreciate your help and understanding\n",
      ", even though we just met. \n",
      "Alright, I think I am good to go then, but your input is much appreciated\n",
      "\n",
      "Well thank you! Let me know if you need help with anything else!\n",
      "no this is something I have to take on from here. But thank you very much for everything!\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a good day then!\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello I am here to help you, what's your problem?\n",
      "I have a licensure exam coming up that I must pass at a 90% score. I have dealt with test anxiety all my life (mind goes blank, difficulty concentrating with noise) and I have to take my exam in a testing center around other people next week. I am extra worried due to COVID. This is a 6 hour exam - what are ways I can calm myself at the exam and succeed?\n",
      "First of all, you can bring some snacks and water. having an empty stomach will distract you from the exam\n",
      "If you were about to take the most important test of your life (ha!) what would you suggest I do to organize my review the days before the exam? Do you have any study suggestions that have worked for you?\n",
      "I have been in that situation many times. From my own experience, yes you should review as much as you can. However, relax the last 2-3 days to not overwhelm yourself. You should also do image training, imagine yourself in the test room, plan ahead what you will do like write your name, open the exam booklet...\n",
      "You give good advice, how have you grown into a calm, cool person? :) What obstacles did you have to overcome to get to this level of chill? \n",
      "It takes alot to grow into that kind of person, I'm not there yet. I find it vital to understand this, you cannot control everything. As long as you try your best, whatever the outcomes are, they all serve a purpose. When one door closes, the others will open\n",
      "That is really helpful advice. I think part of my problem is that I still think I can control every detail and need to learn to let things happen once the ball is in motion. For an exam, I want to do so well because so much is riding on it and that freezes me into trying to control for all outcomes... when really, I can only control myself.\n",
      "You are right, I also want to be in control of my life. However, as I grow older, I realize that is impossible. Whenever you feel stressed over life issues, I would recommend taking a walk in the park or anywhere with a lot of trees to clear you mind\n",
      "I will definitely arrive early to the test center and walk the campus before going in. Get enough to eat beforehand and bring my snacks so I can focus just on the exam. I'm writing all of this down so I don't forget. It is a shame we can't save the chat.\n",
      "Thank you for being my peer-supporter, today. You have been a huge help!\n",
      "sounds like a great plan, i believe you will do well\n",
      "Is there anything I can help you with?\n",
      "Do you have any ideas on what I should about sanitizing my workstation at the exam center? I will be around other people and someone will have used my computer before me. I don't think they are cleaning the stations before the next user.\n",
      "Buy some alcohol wipe, you can find it at the grocery store, make sure to come in early enough to do that\n",
      "Alright. I think the proctors will allow it as long as I don't have a bulky bag with me. Maybe some I can just slip into my pocket. Anything too fussy might be cause for them thinking I am bringing answers in with me. I don't have much else to ask about, these were my main concerns.\n",
      "I believe they sell individual packs of 10 wipes too.Good lick with your exam!~\n",
      "Thanks to your help, I believe I will do well next week. :) \n",
      "Maybe you should be a counselor, if you aren't already. :)\n",
      "I would love to do that, I like talking with people and listen to their stories\n",
      "Hello, how are you doing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello.. I'm good.. Thank you.. How are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am okay. Windy day here\n",
      "ok. I wanted to talk about the highly anxious and nervous situation I was in some time back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Please tell me about it\n",
      "It was due to my work environment. I was given a responsibility, which I wanted to produce good results. So, I ended up working too much time for several months and ignored everything else, including my health.\n",
      "\n",
      "This alienated me from my friends and family\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of that time period, to this day, I'm not as close as I once used to be with my friends\n",
      "\n",
      "I had that tendency too, work was very important to me, sometimes to the detriment of my relationships. Tell me more about the lack of closeness. What's different?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes. I miss out on key moments and I felt left out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any way to speak to them directly about how you feel about that time... tell them what your feeling. People who care for you can be very understanding\n",
      "You don't have to make a big deal about it but I have found that a low key discussion can change things for the better\n",
      "yes. And I will be happy to make more time for friends and family as well.\n",
      "Plus at least you will have stated how you feel and no matter the outcome you can feel like it's been addressed\n",
      "I have found that if something has been bothering me, just dealing with it somehow will make me feel better and enable me to get on with the good aspects of my life\n",
      "True. I feel like I should try that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good luck. A friend of mine used to say \"action alleviates anxiety\" and Ive found that helpful\n",
      "True. This really helped. Thanks for your time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi..how are you doing today\n",
      "Hi..Iam doing good..how are you\n",
      "\n",
      "Iam good..thank you..Iam here to help you about the emotional support you need.Tell me what you want to talk about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Iam in final year of university and iam unable to complete the studies\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh I can relate to that,what is been stopping you from completing your work.\n",
      "Iam a mother of 2 year old son and he is giving me a hard time to finish my work..\n",
      "Oh..Is it possible that your husband helps you in taking care of your toddler..\n",
      "My husband is having full time job and he has to travel an hour to get to work..\n",
      "Oh I can understand that..is there any chance that you can ak your parents to help?\n",
      "My parents live in another country and they cannot come here to my place because they dont have a valid visa..\n",
      "Oh.without a visa i dont think they can enter in to the country..I can see the pain you are going through..\n",
      "Is there any other option for me to consider?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think if you can go for hiring a personal nanny..if you can afford it..What do you say?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am little low on budget and cannot afford a nanny for my kid..or i cannot afford day care centers..\n",
      "Oh that is a problem..ok you can try for applying child care assistance provided by the government to help you take care of your expenses..can you do it?\n",
      "I think i can search for it and work on it..This is a good idea..\n",
      "yeah you can call to local government agencies or any social welfare organizations to help you on this..and I think you will find a solution to your problem..\n",
      "sure..thank you for your help..I really appreciate it..\n",
      "happy to help..I hope you will be feeling better soon..bye..\n",
      "bye,,Stay safe and healthy in this pandemic..\n",
      "Hi there, what is life like for you right now?\n",
      "Pretty stressful. I'm a little bit anxious about school.\n",
      "So you're worried about your studies? I will try to help if I can. Please tell me all you can. \n",
      "Thank you. I am finishing up my third year in college so I have some career decisions to make. I'm also trying to find a job for this summer related to what I want to study.\n",
      "Are you finding that things are being made difficult because of the pandemic?\n",
      "Yes. Most of my classes are online. I really miss my friends and family.\n",
      "I hear you. I think we're all really suffering at the moment. Are you getting any support?\n",
      "I do live with three of my friends so it's nice to have their support. I'm glad I'm not alone\n",
      "\n",
      "What sort of thing do you want to go into when your studies are over?\n",
      "I'm studying psychology, I want to become a therapist or social worker\n",
      "That is a really worth profession. Have you thought of doing some volunteer work before you graduate?\n",
      "Yes! I am trying to get a job at a suicide hotline for the summer\n",
      "That is an awesome thing to do though it could be very mentally draining. Do you feel up to it?\n",
      "I know I'm up to it, but this week I've been having a hard time\n",
      "\n",
      "Just struggling to stay motivated in school\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't put yourself under too much pressure if you are suffering yourself. \n",
      "I try not to. Sometimes it's hard to put myself first\n",
      "\n",
      "I think a lot of people who work helping other people have that sort of problem - it's too easy to neglect yourself. \n",
      "It's good to hear I'm not alone in feeling this way\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about how you're feeling right now?\n",
      "I got a job offer today, I'm very proud of myself!\n",
      "That sounds wonderful - is it the sort of job you were really looking for?\n",
      "Sort of. It's an opportunity to work for one of my favorite professors over the summer. I'm still going to work on that suicide hotline job as well\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't over extend yourself though. Make sure to give yourself plenty of you time. \n",
      "That's a good point. I struggle with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe set aside a few hours each week where you do something just for you, even if someone else claims that they need you. \n",
      "I will try that! Okay, thank you so much for your advice. I'm going to log off now. This has been very helpful.\n",
      "Wait till we hit the fifteen minute mark :D. And you're most welcome, have a lovely day! \n",
      "hello how are you ?\n",
      "I'm in depression because my exam is near and I can't finsh my studies.\n",
      "can i ask you ,why you can't finish \n",
      "It is because i'm very behind in my work.\n",
      "try to catch up with your studies give more time then you feel better\n",
      "How am I going to catch up on my work?\n",
      "i think you need to be confident about your studies then you fell better\n",
      "How can I be confident?\n",
      "i think you need to take more online classes those can help you\n",
      "Ok I will try to get in an online class if I can.\n",
      "because same think happen with me and i took online classes those help me a lot\n",
      "Ok how much time do you spend on online classes?\n",
      "i spend like 3 hours a day on online class \n",
      "Thanks for the idea do you have any more tips?\n",
      "\n",
      "i think you need to take help from your family or friend those who know all about your studies \n",
      "Thanks for helping me I might pass the exam after all.\n",
      "your welcome , thanks for sharing your problem \n",
      "good to talk with you ,bye\n",
      "Hello, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am doing great, how about you?\n",
      "I am doing good. Can I talk to you about something?\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course you can, tell me about it :)\n",
      "I am worried that I won't be able to complete my degree.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't get motivated, it doesn't seem worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey I've been there too, but it really helped me meditating and going out with nature to clear my mind of things. You should try it!\n",
      "What do you meditate about?\n",
      "\n",
      "Nothing special, just sit in my room in silence. Listen to tutorials on youtube to meditate\n",
      "\n",
      "They get me relaxed and motivated for the day :)\n",
      "I feel like I would sit there and worry about things I have not done yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's part of meditation! I too worry while meditating, but when i'm listening to the videos and following instructions all those worries go away :) If that doesn't help you, you can go out in nature to clear your mind off things. Being in the wild really motivates me to continue. \n",
      "Maybe it will calm me down. Does it make it easier to concentrate? \n",
      "\n",
      "Meditating absolutely does since the whole point is to clear your mind off things and concentrate on the task ahead.\n",
      "And the wild? that's whole other experience because you either concentrate on things or you get mesmerized by nature :)\n",
      "That sounds amazing, I should give it a try :)\n",
      "\n",
      "Please do! You can try it with friends or alone. With friends can be a more fun experience while alone can be more spiritual or calming \n",
      "I have tried both and both are amazing :)\n",
      "I would like to experience that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello there, how are you feeling today?\n",
      "Hello. I have a big paper due on Monday and I have anxiety over it since I didn't start it yet.\n",
      "Okay, I know the feeling! Can you at least make a start tonight? That will make you feel better. \n",
      "That would make me feel better but I am going out drinking tonight with my college pals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Naughty! Though I must admit I understand that feeling too ;) Could you not at least rattle out a few paragraphs before you go?\n",
      "That seems feasible. Figuring I had time to come on here and try to make some beer money first.\n",
      "And try not to overdo it or you won't be able to work tomorrow either and then you'll really be in trouble\n",
      "Have you at least done some groundwork for the paper even if you've not started writing it yet?\n",
      "I have read some source materials. Outlined some stuff in my head. Nothing down on paper yet.\n",
      "Yeah I am not planning on getting blackout drunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well at least you can continue mentally preparing for it when you are out tonight \n",
      "Nobody ever INTENDS to get blackout drunk :D \n",
      "Sometimes I intend to, but that is a different story.\n",
      "Yeah I could maybe get some ideas from friends too.\n",
      "\n",
      "And you never know, you might get a creative burst when you get back and rattle it off in one. \n",
      "Alcohol can make people creative. That's for sure.\n",
      "Oh yeah. Follow it up with a smoke and you'll be a regular Shakespeare. He was probably half cut all the time too. \n",
      "YEah or had some good mushrooms. I've been wanting to try shrooms just don\n",
      "\n",

      "i live in a rural area with lots of forests :P \n",
      "I've thought about growing my own but can't do that in the dorms....too risky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmph I am not a very good counsellor am I? I should be telling you to stay in and work. But hey, life is short and beer is good. \n",
      "You gave some good advice . Nothing wrong with a little side chat to prove we are human.\n",
      "Of course :). Hmm it's been many years since I was in Uni. Too many. \n",
      "Probably not too much has changed besides the cost. But that's a whole different story about anxiety. Luckily I am going for engineering and have a half of a chance to get a job once I graduate next year.\n",
      "Ah it's a good field to be in. Do you suffer from anxiety generally or is it just over this paper?\n",
      "Generally but it flairs up more around due dates naturally.\n",
      "and exams too I will bet. Does your school offer any free counselling?\n",
      "Yeah I never looked into it though. I probably should. Good idea.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish you all the best with it and thanks for talking! Do enjoy your night out and don't overdo it ;)\n",
      "Thank you for the help. I am going to start writing some paragraphs now! \n",
      "have fun :P (you have to be the one to press quit first, I can't this side)\n",
      "Hello. I wanted to talk about my academic pressures.\n",
      "Hi there. What academic pressures are troubling you today?\n",
      "Just lots of classes and expectations. Especially with group projects.\n",
      "Needed someone  talk to about my stress and workload. I don't know what to do with these horrible group members.\n",
      "I see. It sounds like being in the group project is especially stressing you out. Would you say that's pretty true?\n",
      "Yes. I have roughly 3 different classes all requiring a group project.\n",
      "I totally understand. When I was in school I remember being stressed out when we had mandatory group projects as well. Having to deal with others can be a bit stressful at times.\n",
      "I agree. I also just don't know which project to proritize\n",
      "\n",
      "I hear you, it sounds like you have a lot going on.\n",
      "What should I do to relax my mind?\n",
      "Have you thought about seeking advice from a close friend or family member? \n",
      "Not yet, I am scared to tell my family, considering that they view academic success heavily\n",
      "\n",
      "With friends, most are busy with their own struggles and I don't want to be bothering them as much\n",
      "\n",
      "I see, it sounds like you are dealing with your academic pressures all on your own right now then?\n",
      "Totally. Feels pretty tiring and heavy\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there possibly a school councilor you could seek advice from?\n",
      "Maybe, but it feels scary and very awkward to seek them\n",
      "\n",
      "I hear you, it's definitely not for everyone. \n",
      "thank you for understanding and talking with me\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course! We all need an ear to listen once in a while :)\n",
      "It really helps to get this off my chest\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so happy to hear that, it sounds like this was something building up. It's always good to let things out in one way or another.\n",
      "ya it does help\n",
      "\n",
      "Is there anything else you would like to talk about today?\n",
      "Thanks for the conversation!\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, and of course! I'm glad I could help.\n",
      "hello, how are you?\n",
      "Can you help me?\n",
      "\n",
      "What help you need? please can you explain\n",
      "I did not study for a test and I very poorly. I feel ashamed!\n",
      "\n",
      "please don't feel shame you can do it\n",
      "nothing is hard if we try\n",
      "Exactly. I did not try!\n",
      "\n",
      "so please try then you feel better\n",
      "where you feel stuck in studies please can you explain\n",
      "I just don't feel motivated to study\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "from today please feel yourself that you know everything about your studies , i think then you fell better\n",
      "ok I will do that. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "give more time to your study then you know everything about your studies\n",
      "I will! I need to put some effort in for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "yes you can do it \n",
      "Ok I will try. I think the problem is not trying for sure.\n",
      "\n",
      "so start from today then tomorrow is better day\n",
      "great advice. thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's all. I feel better now. I'll try more.\n",
      "\n",
      "i face this situation long time ago i try my best and then i come out easily because i try my best\n",
      "hi! Hope you are doing well today\n",
      "How may I assist  you ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey! I’ve been better. Just so stressed out! I don’t handle pressure well.\n",
      "Something is pressuring you and you are stressed due to that. Correct me if I am wrong\n",
      "That’s right. I have three final exams next week and I’ve had the flu so I haven’t been able to study at all.\n",
      "It must be hard for you to prepare for it. I can understand. But there must be a way\n",
      "I’m sure I can figure something out. I’ll definitely have to study all weekend. I just really need to pass. Do you know any good tricks to help study?\n",
      "I can easily see your seriousness and dedication for  your studies. That is awesome thing\n",
      "Thanks! Education is very important in my family. My dad was a teacher so I’ve always had to live up to high expectations.\n",
      "you should take a complete rest for 2-3 hours without worrying and then get up and eat something tasty and healthy. Afterwards sit for preparing for your exam. That's what I do and it helps me a lot.\n",
      "I love that idea! I think I’ll feel much better if I take that time to just relax before I really start working.\n",
      "There is a famous quote \" Worry is a total waste of time. It doesn't change anything. All it does is steal your joy and keep you busy doing nothing.\"\n",
      "Whoever said that sure knew what they were talking about. It’s so true!\n",
      "Any snack recommendations? I’ve got some fruit on hand, but it’s a little boring by itself lol\n",
      "I definitely recommend trail mix or chex mix and one of my favorites is banana chips!\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t think I’ve ever tried banana chips! I’ll have to see if my grocery store has got them. Maybe I can get some delivered by the time I’m ready to study\n",
      "you can find it in any grocery store easily known as  Plantain chips\n",
      "\n",
      "hope you are feeling much better now\n",
      "Thanks so much! I’ve added them and some of my favorite trail mix to my cart. Should be delivered in 1 hour!\n",
      "I am feeling better. Thanks so much for the advice :)\n",
      "That's great to know and best wishes for your exams.\n",
      "Thank you. Enjoy the rest of your day!\n",
      "\n",
      "I cannot keep up with my classes and it is making me anxious\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok. That sounds like something that you should talk to someone about. How many classes are you taking at the moment?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am taking 4 classes and I am struggling with all of them \n",
      "That's tough. A full load of courses. Do you have to take all of them right now? Can you adjust your course load?\n",
      "I have to take them all right now to make sure that I graduate\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a challenging situation. Can you get help from the professor with the deadlines? Maybe you could look into getting a tutor.\n",
      "My professors are trying to help they are actually being really nice. I am just having issues balancing it all honestly. I feel like I can never catch up on anything its just a lot on my plate\n",
      "\n",
      "I think a tutor is actually a really good idea I might look into that \n",
      "\n",
      "Great! I think a tutor will give you some guidance on how to stay on top of your courses. \n",
      "Your situation is not unusual. Many students have difficulty trying to manage it all. Are you working a job as well? \n",
      "I am also working right not\n",
      "\n",
      "sorry my keyboard it messing up lol \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am working right now and its a part time job but it is still a lot for me\n",
      "\n",
      "I think getting my time management under control is also so smart to make sure I can balance everything with less anxiety\n",
      "Ok. No worries! Can you adjust your hours at your job? Do you need the money, or can you maybe take a short break from work until you catch up?\n",
      "\n",
      "So I do actually need the money. I just moved out on my own and I have a lot of bills that I use to not have when I was living with my parents. I might be able to cut back a couple hours a week but then I might have to give up some fun things I like to do \n",
      "True. Once you're on the other side of this semester, you can put in more hours. Do you absolutely have to finish this semester, or can you put off a course until the next term?\n",
      "I would like to finish this semester just because I have a job lined up for me right when I graduate where I can make a lot more money and not struggle as much financially \n",
      "Is the job contingent on graduation? Maybe you could take one course while you do the job. Work full-time and study  part-time.\n",
      "I do have to have the degree to start the job thats the only part that isnt great. I would love to start at that company and go to school but they wont allow it. \n",
      "Do you have to get high grades in the courses, or just pass?\n",
      "Luckily I just have to pass so it makes it a little less stressful\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If I actually had to get a high grade oh man that would be the worst\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok. Do your best to pass. Try to cut back an hour or two at the job. Keep you eyes on the prize: the full-time job after graduation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah it all seems so far away but I just have to remind myself to look at the bright side and that something great is waiting for me at the end \n",
      "Great! Best of luck with everything then!\n",
      "How are you doing today ?\n",
      "It is a stressful time , why are you feeling stressed ?\n",

      "Academically and musically. IDK other talents I guess. \n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder if you could suggest to your dad that he goes back to school himself rather than living through you?\n",
      "Like as a whole human being I should be perfect. \n",
      "\n",
      "I hope I have been able to be of help to you but I am afraid I need to see someone else now. Thank you for talking though and I wish you all the very best in future \n",
      "Ok. Thank you for your time. Have a good one. \n",
      "Can you press quit first as it has to be done from your end :) \n",
      "Oh sorry. I thought I just did. \n",
      "it can be temperamental :) \n",
      "Hi there, how are you doing today?\n",
      "I doing good.. how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am good thanks. What would you like to talk to me about?\n",
      "I am going to school and this  semester I am having too much pressure ... could not handle it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that. Have you got anyone you can talk to? Maybe take some time off? \n",
      "I cannot take any time off since this is in the middle of the semester. And dropp\n",
      "ing any class is not an option either. \n",
      "So you feel that you are trapped and yet you are not coping properly?\n",
      "I am having too much anxiety and don't know how to deal with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest that you talk to a counsellor.  There should be free services available at your university.\n",
      "What kind of advise should I be seeking from the counsellor?\n",
      "Well, perhaps they can at least alleviate your anxiety somewhat. Or maybe even get you a sick note to give you a little extra  time to complete your assignment.s\n",
      "Do you think that could hurt my grade if I turn them in\n",
      " late?\n",
      "No, as long as you have a doctor's letter explaining why. \n",
      "But I am not sick, would the counsellor write note for me under this situation?\n",
      "\n",
      "There is more than one way to be sick. You sound as though you are suffering from depression and stress. \n",
      "I guess you are right... I will try to make an appointment with the counselor next week.\n",
      "Do you have any friends or family that you can discuss this with?\n",
      "I have an elder sister I can talk to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is she sympathetic to what you are feelign? \n",
      "Well that is a good start. Maybe you could make a list of things you want to discuss with your counsellor too. \n",
      "I like the idea .. thanks..\n",
      "\n",
      "Try not to worry - I hope that things go well with you. \n",
      "I hope so.. thank you for you suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the best to you in your future and thank you for talking! \n",
      "You have to press quit first cos I can't :) \n",
      "You have a good day...\n",
      "\n",
      "Can you press quit and take the survey :) \n",
      "Hi, how are you today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am okay. What is going on with you? \n",
      "School's going badly. I really wish I had chosen a different major.\n",
      "It sounds like it must be overwhelming to keep up with all of your school work. \n",
      "I’m majoring in computer engineering. It’s really #%$& hard! Everyone else is way smarter than I am.\n",
      "\n",
      "That does sound very difficult, but I think you can do it! Just getting into a program like that shows how smart you are!\n",
      "It's kinda late to switch. I'm at the end of my third year. My parents keep bugging me about getting a job.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest with you, I switched majors a lot in college. I eventually let go of what my family thought and pursued a career I would truly enjoy for myself. \n",
      "I wish I were in your shoes! If I change majors now, I have to redo at least a year of school, maybe more. I don't think my parents want to pay for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally I took three years longer than it should to get my degree and accrued some debt because of it. Although I feel it is worth it now.  \n",
      "That's good to know. Maybe I can convince my parents to let me borrow some money. I don't want to be a computer engineer. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm hearing its difficult for you knowing that you are on a path that you don't really want to be on. \n",
      "That's a good way to put it. \n",
      "I've thought a lot about my options.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've thought about take a leave of absence, switching majors, going to trade school, traveling abroad...\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people I know benefited from talking to an advisor or counselor for some direction. Have you done that recently?\n",
      "I talked to the school counselor. They laid out some options. It's really about money and time. If those weren't concerns, I would switch in a heartbeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "What about meeting with the counselor with your parents, since it seems they would need to support you financially over any extra time it might take? \n",
      "That's a good point. Maybe we could have a Zoom meeting, even for just 15 minutes. I need to get my parents to understand my feelings. \n",
      "\n",
      "The counselor might help me with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been shown that healthy communication can help people listen and respond more considerately when things seem difficult at first.\n",
      "I hadn't thought of it that way. I'm so worried about schoolwork that I hadn't stepped back from the whole situation of school itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I definitely can understand that, but it is important to think about your future happiness and security too! \n",
      "Thanks again for all your help! Your words have been really insightful!\n",
      "Hi, how are you doing today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am doing alright.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am good, thanks. Is there an issue I can provide you some support with?\n",
      "Yeah I am pretty anxious all the time. I feel that I made a mistake coming back to school to get a PhD.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, to reiterate, you are suffering from anxiety due to school? Or is your anxiousness also caused by other life factors as well?\n",
      "School is the start of the problem. I know that if I quit I can still be successful elsewhere but I also feel if I quit I will let my wife and kids down who were willing to leave family and friends to follow me to the school I wanted to go to. \n",
      "\n",
      "I understand what you are going through. It is as if you are being pulled in two directions, but are not sure which is the best option at the given moment. I think it is great that you wanted to go back to school, but if your heart is not in it, then it may not be what you should continue pursuing. \n",
      "I know I want this though. I enjoy what I do and what I would do for my career if I graduate. I mainly feel inadequate. I feel that I am not good enough. I am willing to do whatever it takes but fear that whatever my \"best\" is may not be good enough. \n",
      "I can feel your worries when you speak about your anxiety, and I am hoping we can find a way to approach your feelings. Do you think there was a specific instance that is causing doubts within yourself or is it in your nature to self-doubt?\n",
      "It is in my nature to self doubt. Additionally, I have had a few bumps in the road during my program and struggle to pick myself up after those bumps. For example, I am on academic probation and have a certain expectation over the next few months that I have to hit to stay in the program due to struggles in previous classes. I am reaching the bar just fine, according to those that I work with, and often feel I am doing quite well but occasionally I start to panic and think that I am not doing as well as I think that I am and start to spiral\n",
      "\n",
      "This has also been a past struggle of mine, and I think it partially stems from the bar we set so high for ourselves. We obviously cannot reach the top right away, but have to work our way up. Often times, when facing an obstacle, such as a bad grade, we might retreat further down the path due to fear that it will keep happening. I know that I personally had a tendency to think of my family and friends who I feel are dependent on me or comparing myself with others when the only person we should think of in these instances is ourself. When making progress, tiny steps upward matter more than you think. But when we take a step backward, we cannot fall back down to the starting point by letting our doubts pile upon one another.\n",
      "That is a really good point and helpful. Thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, I am happy to help! I have noticed that letting yourself celebrate a good grade can be really helpful to feel that you are enough and making good progress. But when things do go south, because life certainly happens, we must stay in the present and live life like we usually would, with a drive that we are going to push harder against whatever we have to face next. \n",
      "That is exactly right. I need to focus more on what progress has been made and not on what progress hasn't been made yet because there is still time to make that progress. \n",
      "\n",
      "Exactly! I also suggest if you are having doubts, talk it out with someone like your partner or a close friend. They can often provide a pick me up you didn't even know you needed. More than anything, give yourself credit and relax. Take some time to just breathe and release the tension. I guarantee it will leave you feeling refreshed and fulfilled for the next tasks you have to face. I believe you can do this and I feel that you believe it too, which is amazing. As often as it is said, believing in yourself is truly the best foundation to achieve your goals.\n",
      "Thanks for the advice and believing in me. This has been challenging and your words of encouragement give me hope for the future\n",
      ". \n",
      "You're welcome. It was great talking to you. Your future is bright, and I wish you all of the luck for the endeavors to get you there.\n",
      "Thanks! Same to you!\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy the rest of your day!\n",
      "\n",
      "You too! Thanks again. \n",
      "I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies\n",
      "yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.\n",
      "\n",
      "that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through \n",
      "I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.\n",
      "i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before\n",
      "So what you did? how you came out of it?\n",
      "\n",
      "i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library \n",
      "That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.\n",
      "yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown\n",
      "That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?\n",
      "\n",
      "always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me \n",
      "and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing \n",
      "\n",
      "Is there any specific exercise?\n",
      "\n",
      "you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "good \n",
      "is there any other thing i can help you with?\n",
      "I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee\n",
      "\n",
      "you are very welcome and good luck with your studies\n",
      "Hi, I am hear to listen today. How are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "i am not well\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that and I have felt that way myself. Has something unusual happened that you would like to share?\n",
      "i have an exam coming up annd i dont wanna fail\n",
      "I understand and that can be very concerning. Have you been preparing for the test or have you had anyone to study with? I know that can sometimes help with preparedness. \n",
      "i dont have anyone and i live alone. i feel that my scholarship will be taken away if i fail\n",
      "I know that can be very difficult and I am proud of you reaching out for help and support! You are making great strides in talking about your feelings!\n",
      "A scholarship would reflect that you are very dedicated to school and that you are deserving of this award. You have a lot to be proud of, having attained a scholarship. I also had one and it can feel like a lot of pressure though.\n",
      "should i go to my school councellor\n",
      "Yes, that is a great idea. Have you ever joined a study group? A group of peers can also be helpful.\n",
      "I have been really upset as people from my study group dont respond to my emails\n",
      "I am sorry to hear that and know that could make you really sad. Do you have a relationship with a professor at your school? One that you can talk to about your feelings?\n",
      "I dont have a professor i can trust or feel comfortable taking to\n",
      "I also dont have any family \n",
      "i have general anxiety disorder\n",
      "Okay, I can understand your feelings. Have you heard of practice tests?\n",
      "i couldnt study because I have chronic pain issues\n",
      "I have experienced a little bit of what you are describing and I am so happy that you have reached out regardless of your obstacles. Have you ever tried to write down what you're feeling?\n",
      "i have never tries writing down my feelings\n",
      "\n",
      "I think it can help release feelings and help ground people. Do you have family that has experienced what you are feeling or been through college o a scholarship? I would suggest reaching out to family in the case of feeling anxiety. \n",
      "i dont have a lot of family. I am new to this country as wel. due to covid i cant fly back home.\n",
      "Hi, how are you doing today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not too great, honestly. \n",
      "Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there something in particular that's wrong?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am struggling to keep up with all of the assignments in my classes and I am anxious that I am going to fail some of them. \n",
      "That sounds really stressful\n",
      "It really is hard to manage\n",
      "Are you in a program that lets you choose your own classes?\n",
      "Three of them were required for majors in my year, unfortunately. \n",
      "Oh, that's rough. I've had classes before where I had to take them but had a lot of trouble.\n",
      "Do you know anyone in the class? Maybe you could try studying with them and see if they can help.\n",
      "I have a couple friends in the same classes but there is so much material it is hard to find any time to get together. \n",
      "It sounds like you're overwhelmed by all of the things expected of you\n",
      "Sometimes schools have programs that can help with this sort of thing, like student support services, that might be able to get you extensions on assignments, or move tests around if they fall on a similar date.\n",
      "That sounds like a great idea but I am not sure if they will have any sympathy for me. \n",
      "You might be right, it depends on the school honestly. It might not hurt to try though if you're really overwhelmed. Another thought is to try talking to your professors or TAs? They might be more sympathetic than you think.\n",
      "You're right. I guess it would be worth the time and effort to at least ask. That is probably better than just suffering. \n",
      "\n",
      "I've been a TA for classes before, and even though I sometimes can't do too much to change assignment deadlines, I've always been open to talking to students about their struggles. It helps me to know who to keep an eye on and give extra attention to.\n",
      "\n",
      "Are you feeling any external pressure from your family or advisor to do really well?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't really have much of a support system. I really am just trying to self motivate.\n",
      "That sounds so hard, I think it's awesome that you're trying so hard on your own. Just the fact that you're in a program in the first place is really impressive.\n",
      "\n",
      "I hope you're able to find a support system through your friends, even if you don't have one at home.\n",
      "I hope so too. \n",
      "Thanks for talking with me. \n",
      "I know it's hard, but I think you're going to do a great job! And even if you fail a test, it really doesn't matter in the long run. \n",
      "\n",
      "You are absolutely right. \n",
      "It was great talking with you\n",
      "Hi Can I help you\n",
      "Hi, I'm having trouble with this distance learning. It seems more difficult than in-class learning. Most of my teachers just post lessons on the classroom website, and there's not a lot of guided instruction. My grades are slipping. I'm used to getting mostly A's, and now I'm mainly making Cs. It has me really anxious.\n",
      "My son have same issue. We have to deal with this covid situation.\n",
      "I can understand how you feel. It is very difficult\n",
      "Yes, I'm so tired of it! I never thought I'd say this, but I'm ready to go back to school!\n",
      "School started already . That good idea to go and attend \n",
      "We aren't doing in-class learning. My mom is high-risk so I'm not attending to minimize possible exposure. The option is there, but if you can't because of health reasons, they let you stay home and do online learning all week. For my mom's sake, that's what I'm doing.\n",
      "You are so kind. Thinking about your parents. Only few months you have to deal. She will get vaccine soon\n",
      "Hopefully she can get the vaccine soon. She's afraid of it because it's new, but she knows she has to get it. \n",
      "She's been talking to her doctor about setting up an appointment. I've heard the second dose can make you feel pretty gross, so that's what I'm worried about. I hope it doesn't affect her too bad.\n",
      "I got last week my first dose. Tell her not to be scared at all.\n",
      "Don't worry at all. Believe me\n",
      "Oh that's great! Does it hurt? I know I should get it eventually but I'm low on the priority list cuz I'm healthy. But I'm afraid to get it because I'm terrified of needles lol\n",
      "Thank you, you're too kind\n",
      "Not at all. It is very easy. Easier than flu shot\n",
      "Oh, good. That does make me feel better. Thank you for that.\n",
      "I hope once she's able to be vaccinated, I'll be able to get back in the classroom for learning. Then maybe my grades will improve\n",
      "Covid has had me very anxious the past year. School hasn't been as easy as it used to be, and I've been worried about my mom getting it.\n",
      "Definitely. I am assuring you will be fine very soon.\n",
      "Thank you for saying that. This has made me feel much better. \n",
      "I feel heavy pressures from my parents, they also want me to be the top of the class but I find it tough because they are other top students\n",
      "Please what do I do?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hi! how are you doing today?\n",
      "\n",
      "Not so good, I'm feeling down\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds like you have low energy. What makes you feel down?\n",
      "My parents keep putting pressures on me to be the best in the class and with my learning difficulties I am finding it had to cope \n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand parental pressure. They want to see you to be a successful person. Sometime it is overwhelming. you should talk to them that you are doing your best.\n",
      "I have tried, I am even doing extra classes but they still keep on putting pressure on me. On top of that all my friends have distant from me for no reason and they ganged up on me to bully me \n",
      "\n",
      "It must be tough time for you. show your work report to your parents and try to tell them all the people are born with different potential.\n",
      "Hmm...That doesn't seem like a bad idea. I am just worry that my parents will not be very understanding. My parents are too strict and they don't like to hear any complaints or excuses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the parents behave like this when it is regarding their kids future. When I was in school same thing happened with mw. They know us very well I realized now.  Try to talk to them everyday for a while. It might work.\n",
      "Maybe you're right! Although, my parents have a very busy schedule but fingers crossed when I do find time to talk to them they will understand me. \n",
      "I sometimes feel like someone older needs to talk to them, maybe then my parents may take it more seriously\n",
      "\n",
      "Well! Thanks I give what you said a go\n",
      "\n",
      "Hope you are feeling bit relaxed now. \n",
      "Yes! I feel a lot better now that I know someone understands how I feel \n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad that I am able to make you happy. \n",
      "How should I respond to the friends that are ganging up on me?\n",
      "\n",
      "sure! You don't have to worry about that. that should be their problem. just ignore them or don't give attention. They will stop doing it for sure.\n",
      "Hmm..interesting because now that I think about it, I believe this could have contributed to the stress and anxieties that I have been experiencing. When I don't get support from anyone I feel so alone, timid and down \n",
      "\n",
      "Try to take small break while studying and try to relax \n",
      "Yes, I find that has helped me a bit also because I have quite a short attention span . Also, I am currently on the path of trying to find more unique techniques to help revision more fun and exciting for me \n",
      "\n",
      "That's great! you will do awesome.\n",
      "Thank you very much! I feel much better now and I've taken on board what you said, hopefully there will be a positive change in my parents character. :)\n",

      "\n",
      "What is it about the Zoom classes that you find stressful?\n",
      "I am learned Excel, and the teacher is presenting her excel sheet, but Zoom is on my phone and it is hard to learn on a tiny screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can relate to that totally. I have had a hard time learning Zoom too. Mostly I have trouble with the audio though. It can be frustrating\n",
      "It is frustrating, and last week, I had a panic attack shortly before class started. My ears were pounding and I could hear nothing the instructor was saying through my earbuds. \n",
      "I know that is very difficult. When our anxieties take over it can be hard to think clearly. \n",
      "Have you tried casting the zoom on to a larger screen?\n",
      "Yes. It is also hard to concentrate when my nephews are at home. Most of the monitors and TVs are taken by other household members, but I think I will buy another monitor. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think getting yourself a new monitor is a great idea!\n",
      "I have a laptop, but I need it full screened for Excel and Zoom takes up too much space, so that is why I had it on my phone. But I think a second monitor is an excellent idea, thank you. \n",
      "In the meantime, take some deep breaths when you feel yourself start to get anxious. It may be helpful to explain the situation to your teacher as well\n",
      "It sounds like you are trying to solve the issue but get overwhelmed like we all do. I think you are doing a great job. All of this new stuff is difficult to learn\n",
      "Thank you so much for your help.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will tell my teacher as well.\n",

      "Have you tried explaining to them that you are trying to study?\n",
      "Yes, but they are rowdy.\n",
      "\n",

      "I think I will ask my sister if I can use the laundry room as a little office so that I can close the door.\n",

      "Yes, I will try to resolve something with her. Thank you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello, how can I help you today?\n",
      "I'm really stressed with school exams\n",
      "\n",
      "and I'm struggling with anxiety\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed?\n",
      "I have 3 big exams coming up at the same time, and they're all really important for my final grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know I'm going to badly because I haven't been learning well during the pandemic\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse.\n",
      "Currently, on a scale of 1-10 how well are you understanding your course material?\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can't make any progress studying.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's completely normal you haven't made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on!\n",
      "I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it's really not going to be good. I'm on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3.0 gpa\n",
      "\n",
      "Would you say your problems start with your roommates?\n",
      "They're the biggest problem right now. But I think having to learn from home is the main problem. It's so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. No library, no office hours, no study groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line\n",
      "Are you a student too?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self-manage without the right resources\n",
      "Yeah, I wish the professors and university would be more flexible\n",
      "\n",
      "When the pandemic first started, we didn't have grades, and that was really helpful\n",
      "\n",
      "Ah and then they started rolling in, correct?\n",
      "Yeah, even though nothing has really changed\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel like until way more people get the vaccine, we're still in the pandemic\n",
      "\n",
      "Me too, unfortunately for us, universities don't seem t have the same sentiments.\n",
      "For starters, I think it would benefit you to eliminate the more closer problems: your roommates\n",
      "Have you tried talking to them?\n",
      "Thanks for that suggestion. I have tried, but they are immature and just want to party. I've started staying in my room which helps, but is very isolating. I wish I could afford my own place\n",
      "\n",
      "Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma\n",
      "Are you currently working?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, just a student. I will try to get a job this summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "hi, can you help me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello  What is on your mind today?\n",
      "Well, school has just been getting so stressful, I don't have the motivation to keep up in class\n",
      "so your not feeling motivated to do you school work?\n",
      "Thats tough , do you have a set school time?\n",
      "Kind of, but the schedule is a bit weird, like every other day I only have an afternoon class and on the others I have both morning and afternoon, and if a teacher has a meeting then no class. Now that I'm saying it I guess it is a bit irregular.\n",
      " it sounds like your schedule is different almost everyday. I know I find schedule changes like that to be hard to manage \n",
      "Yeah, my sleeping schedule is also very irregular due to this. At most I get 5 hours on a good day\n",
      "\n",
      "ouch without the right amount of sleep , everything is difficult. Have you thought of setting your own schedule to follow?\n",
      "I'm not really good with stuff like that, every time I try and make a schedule for myself I end up disregarding it because there'\n",
      "s just no point\n",
      "Also I think i should mention that I do online school through google meet\n",
      "no point- what do you mean by that ?\n",
      "I mean that its not like anyone is holding me to the schedule anyways, and I feel like I should spend my time doing something I like instead, you know?\n",
      "\n",
      "I see - you find it hard to stay motivated when something pulls your attention to something you are more interested in doing . Does that sound right ?\n",
      "Have you thought about why doing your school work is important ?\n",
      "Yeah, I know its important and I always end up finishing it, it just seems like there is not enough time and the feeling drags me down. I don't have long until I graduate, but I cant find the motivation. Instead of learning in class, I end up teaching myself the content two hours before an assignment is due.\n",
      "have you thought about scheduling free time for your self ? It can give you something to look forward to and help keep you motivated /Almost like a reward for finishing your school work\n",
      "I schedule free time for myself during classes, after classes and throughout the day, its never been like a reward though\n",
      "\n",
      "maybe if you only schedule free time and school work time - you can use it as a reward- plus it would help you stay on task \n",
      "true, how do i stop myself from turning it into all free time though?\n",
      "\n",
      "good question- changing any pattern takes practice . You could use the 3 r's  Reminder- Routine and Reward   \n",
      "okay, that sounds good\n",
      "great  so glad we came up with a plan \n",
      "yeah, thanks for the help\n",
      "no problem  thanks for sharing your story \n",
      "Hello. I'm looking for some help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good Morning! would you like to tell me whats going on?\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a big test coming up for a college class and I am very anxious about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "you seem really concerned about a big test coming up and its making you feel anxious.  is that correct?\n",
      "Yeah exactly. I feel like my future depends on getting a good grade on this test.\n",
      "\n",
      "just from chatting with you, I can feel how anxious you are.\n",
      "I've been studying every day for weeks but I still can't help but feel really anxious. I don't know what to do. It's messing with my sleep schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "your doing your best and continuing to try hard!\n",
      "it's great that you are working so hard to pass this test.\n",
      "I'm trying my best I'm just worried it won't be enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "deep breaths can help people calm down. Can you try and take a few deep breaths?\n",
      "Yes, I can try to do that more often.\n",
      "\n",
      "how confidant do you feel with the material? \n",
      "I'm fairly certain I have most of it memorized but what happens if I freeze up and forget during the test?\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel the same way when I am taking a big exam! Try to remember to breath and not be so anxious that will only cause you to forget everything you studied.  You seem very intelligent and I know you can do this!\n",
      "Thank you! Do you think taking a practice exam would help?\n",
      "\n",
      "yes I think a practice exam would be a great way to put you at ease and help you work on anything you might need to freshen up on.\n",
      "Ok, I will try that out. I appreciate talking to you I feel better already.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was very nice speaking with you today.  Good luck! remember deep breaths and I know you'll be just fine.\n",
      "I'll remember that! Thank you again!\n",
      "Hi there! How can I help you today\n",
      "i cant keep up in class\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm so sorry to hear that. How does that make you feel?\n",
      "like crap, it makes me not wanna do anything\n",
      "\n",
      "I understand completely, it can be hard to keep up in class especially if you're feeling down \n",
      "To be clear, you're feeling bad about not being able to keep up in class and that's making you feel even worse about it?\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah, like I want to start doing better but then i realize theres just no point im already behind\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't worry, that's totally normal, especially since a lot of things are online these days. I personally struggled with keeping up with courses, but I found a way to make it work by pushing to the limits\n",
      "\n",
      "okay, i guess its good to know im not the only one \n",
      "\n",
      "how did you get thru it?\n",
      "\n",
      "I suggest starting with what you missed first instead of worrying what you're getting now\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe let your teacher/professor know how you're doing in class and you may be able to ask for extensions on deadlines\n",
      "i am a little scared to ask my teacher though\n",
      "\n",
      "shes really mean and what if she fails me?\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't be afraid! Remember a teacher's job is to teach and help you, she may look a little mean but it doesn't hurt to try and ask, she can't fail you for being confused :)\n",
      "\n",
      "yeah i guess your right\n",
      "Does that make you feel a little better about it?\n",
      "yea, a lot better actually, thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "You're welcome! Anything else I can help out with?\n",
      "what should i do about the work i missed?\n",
      "hmm, i suggest you should ask your teacher if its still alright to submit it. If you decide to do them, make sure its ok with her first\n",
      "okay, thanks, i will do that\n",
      "\n",
      "No problem! Glad I was able to help! Is there anything else?\n",
      "no thats all, thanks again for helping me\n",
      "\n",
      "Hello! how are you feeling today?\n",
      "\n",
      "I am pretty anxious lately.  I have a lot of stuff going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks like you have a lot to do. Correct me if I am wrong.\n",
      "You would be correct.  I have Spring Break coming up and then right after that I have to start getting ready for my finals.  I am in my last year of college and I am feeling the pressure of having to become a real adult.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can understand you very. well. It happen with all of us in such situation. Last year of the college  really give lot of pressure.\n",
      "College in general has been a struggle.  I have to work a full time job at the same time I am going to school full time because my family couldn't afford to help me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am pretty sure you will do great in you exam and I can see that in your worries. You are not alone in this situation as colleges are so expensive so it's hard for parents to pay for it.\n",
      "Yea, I hope your right.  I just have a hard time coming up with a plan to study and work and still have time for a regular life.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I was in college, I went throgh the same phase as you are facing. Even my parent couldn't afford my college expense.  Yes, just concentrate on your study.\n",
      "It helps to know that other people have had similar experiences to mine.  It makes me feel less alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "You are not alone. It is a phase of life. all have to go through it. Just stay focused and calm and motivated.\n",
      "Yea, maybe going on spring break will help to get my mind off all the work I have to do when I get back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Enjoy your spring break and come up with freshness. I am pretty sure you will do very well.\n",
      "Thank you.  I will.  Do you have any suggestions on how I can plan for how to study once I get back?  Should I see a doctor to get some medicine for my anxiety?\n",
      "\n",
      "The best way to plan your study is to set the target for a particular day that you have to complete it. Once you achieve it, you will be motivated and it will help you to do more work. you can take doctors opinion if it's required. you can take few breaks to relax youself in middle.\n",
      "That's good advice.  Thank you.  I will try to put some of this to good use.\n",
      "\n",
      "My best wishes are there with you. May God give all  success that you wished for.\n",
      "Thank you so much for your insight.  I will be praying for a good outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "you will get it for sure! is there anything else I can help you with?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think you have eased my mind a little.  I feel better.  Thanks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a wonderful evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "All my pleasure! Wonderful evening to you too\n",
      "hi how are you today? How can I assist you?\n",
      "I'm feeling really stressed. I'm about to graduate from college, but my last two classes are killing me. I keep having dreams that I've been forgetting to go to a third class and now I won't graduate.\n",
      "It's keeping me from being able to concentrate on the real classes.\n",
      "It seems you are working really hard and in stress due to your classes. \n",
      "Yes, I am working really hard.\n",
      "The good part is you are giving your best and keep doing it. don't think too much about the result. These kind of dreams are the worries inside you. \n",
      "It's hard not to think about the result when the stress is interfering with my studying. I don't know how to manage the stress.\n",
      "I can understand the situation you are going through. You are working hard and keep doing it and try to mediate for few minutes in a day. Hope that will release your stress.\n",
      "Okay, meditation. I can do that. \n",
      "But what else can I do?\n",
      "When I am in stress I do mediation and it gives me relaxation and a new way to think. sometime our body and mind need peace to work better.\n",
      "I've never meditated before. I'm not sure how. I even worry about meditating, my goodness.\n",
      "Mediation is just to concentrate on your breath. There are so many videos on internet. You can take short break when you feel exhausted and talk to friend and family for a while. It will help you. \n",
      "Okay, I'll try that. Hopefully it helps.  I'm just so worried about graduating now that I'm so close.\n",
      "You will graduate with flying colors. My best wishes are there with you. stay focused and calm. That's the mantra. Hope you will achieve whatever you want. Best wishes!\n",
      "I'm so close to getting  my degree, and it's been a long time coming!\n",
      "Is there something else that I can help you with? The time will go fast. don't worry\n",
      "I know, only two months left! And I only had two classes left this semester, so maybe that's why I keep dreaming I've forgotten a class.\n",
      "Did you have a similar experience sometime?\n",
      "You can do it I am pretty sure. Keep working on your goal.\n",
      "I had such kind of anxiety when I was in college. The best way to come out from it is to stay focused and calm.\n",
      "It does make me feel better that it's a pretty universal feeling.\n",
      "yes, It happen with all human being I believe.\n",
      "Hi, how are you?\n",
      "\n",
      "Doing good.. How are you?\n",
      "I'm feeling really anxious these days. \tI'm finding the COVID online learning experience to be too much for me at this time. I want to stop school, but I don't think I can afford to. I need to get done with school.\n",
      "I understand your frustration. All of us are challenged due to COVID.\n",
      "School was always hard. Now it's gotten harder. I think a lot of people are stressed. \n",
      "\n",
      "How long are you doing the online school?\n",
      "Last semester and this semester. It feels like a lot longer though. \n",
      "What are you missing most? Friends?\n",
      "A balance in life. I spend so much time online. I'm always staring at a screen. I would like to get aware from the computer.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the vaccination started, I believe we will be back to normal soon.. \n",
      "Yeah, I can't wait for things to return to normal. Until then, I don't know what I can do to feel normal.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw some of my friends hang out in zoom... having virtual drinks.. have you tried that?\n",
      "No, I haven't. I thought it wouldn't be the same as really hanging out. I don't drink. I do like to play board games though.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will not be same.. but better than being alone.. \n",
      "That's true. I wanted to play board games online with some friends, but they weren't interested. It's not the same thing to play with strangers.\n",
      "I have a group with my elementary school friends.. we hang out in zoom because we all are spread out across the globe.. some times.. it;s fun as we can share a lot of memories..\n",
      "\n",
      "That's great. I wish I had kept in touch with my friends from those days. I'm not really much for just socializing though. I like some kind of activity, like games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Got you.. try to form a group on-line with the people you know.. at least until this CONVID thing is over..\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok. Not really sure how to form a group. I want to reach out, but so many people are flaky. They makes plans then bail at the last minute. \n",
      "\n",
      "For sure you would find someone.. if you keep looking..\n",
      "\n",
      "Ok. Will do. I'll see what I can get done. Thanks for your help.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have a good day!\n",
      "Could you please close the chat.. \n",
      "\n",
      "HI how are you today\n",
      "\n",
      "going good what about you\n",
      "how was your day\n",
      "I'm taking some classes and I didn't do well on my midterms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't worry my friend there will be peaks and downs in life same in exam too prepare hard for your next exam surely you ll shine\n",
      "I hope so. I don't have a lot of hope.\n",
      "\n",
      "do u attend your classes regularly?\n",
      "Yes for the most part. Unless a family emergency arises.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's great. Did u love your studies?\n",
      "I guess so. I want to have a good career.\n",
      "\n",
      "That's a good idea. Even I had this problem during my studies\n",
      "I think it's a common problem, but I don't feel good about it.\n",
      "Then my friend suggested me to study at early morning rather than evening and nights. \n",
      "That's a good idea. I feel more productive in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "I might try that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to have a water bottle behind u when u study and try to concentrate more and its best to choose a peaceful place to study.\n",
      "Yes, drinking water helps with concentration. \n",
